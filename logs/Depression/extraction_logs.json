Also maybe \"Suicidal Ideation -... question\" but that's part of C-SSRS? Actually separate questions within C-SSRS. But markers might be the specific questions? Probably treat them as separate markers? In earlier examples, they didn't break down individual questions unless explicitly named. Here many \"Suicidal Ideation -...\" etc. These are distinct items/questions. Should we list each? Might be too many. But requirement: extract ONLY markers explicitly present. So yes, each question is a marker. But maybe too many. However guidelines: markers are quantitative criteria and features. Questions are qualitative. But still considered markers? In example 5, they had BDNF, MEP, HRSD-NOW. They did not list each suicidal question separately. So probably we should list main scales and overall metrics like \"Suicidal Ideation - Any Methods (Not Plan)\" etc. But maybe group under C-SSRS? But they are separate items. Could list each as separate marker. Let's see pattern: In example 5, they had \"Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)\", \"Transcranial magnetic stimulation evoked potentials (MEP)\", \"HRSD-NOW\". They didn't list each component of HRSD. So for C-SSRS, we might list \"C-SSRS Baseline\" and \"C-SSRS Since Last Visit\" as markers? But those are just timing.

So marker: MADRS: Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score.\n\n- Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Acronym SDS. Marker: SDS: Sheehan Disability Scale total score.\n\n- Q-LES-Q-SF: Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form. Acronym Q-LES-Q-SF. Marker: Q-LES-Q-SF: Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form total score.\n\n- CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression – Improvement.

So we can include \"MADRS Responder Rate\" but need acronym? Maybe \"MADRS-R\" but not given. We'll just use \"MADRS Responder Rate\".\n\nAlso \"MADRS total score ≤12\" threshold.

Wait: The first line: \"The PHQ-9 is used to measure a person's level of depression. Scores on the measure can range from 0 to 27.\" Then next paragraph: \"The measure will be used as a second assessment to measure depression. Scores on the measure can range from 0 to 63.\" That likely refers to PHQ-9? No, PHQ-9 max 27. So maybe it's PHQ-9 and PHQ-9? Or maybe it's PHQ-9 and PHQ-9? Actually PHQ-9 is 9 items, max 27. Another measure with 0-63 could be PHQ-9? No. Maybe it's PHQ-9 and PHQ-9? Wait there is PHQ-9 and PHQ-9? There's PHQ-9 and PHQ-9? Might be PHQ-9 and PHQ-9? I'm confused.

Could be PHQ-9 again? But 0-63 suggests maybe PHQ-9? Actually PHQ-9 is 9 items each 0-3 => max 27. PHQ-9 can't go to 63. There is PHQ-9? There's PHQ-9? There's PHQ-9? There's PHQ-9? There's PHQ-9?

According to rule: If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form. But we need to extract markers explicitly present. The second measure is not named, but we know it's a depression measure with 0-63. Could be PHQ-9? But it's not named. Should we still list it? The instruction: \"extract ONLY markers explicitly present in the text.\" The second measure is not named, so maybe we don't include it. However, we might consider that it's a second PHQ-9? But the text says \"The measure will be used as a second assessment to measure depression.\" It's ambiguous. I'd err on safe side: Only include PHQ-9 and SF-12. Because the second measure isn't named, we cannot give an acronym. But we could create a logical abbreviation? The rule says: \"If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form.\" But does that apply to markers? The marker is the measure itself.

For some markers there might not be acronym; e.g., \"OCL score\" could be \"OCL: One Card Learning test score\". Or \"DET: Detection test score\". But we need to use acronym if available. For \"One Card Learning\" it's abbreviated OCL. For \"Detection\" maybe just \"DET\". For \"Identification\" maybe \"IDN\"? Actually IDN stands for \"Identification\"?

Maybe \"UTI\" but not explicit. But we can use \"UTI: Urinary Tract Infection incidence\". But not sure. The instruction says always use acronym if available. If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form. So we can create \"CYSTITIS: Cystitis incidence\". But maybe better \"UTI: Urinary Tract Infection incidence\". But the record lists multiple conditions together. We can combine them into one marker: \"AEs: Incidence of cystitis, urinary tract infections, renal and urinary tract symptoms, renal and urinary disorders\". Use \"AEs\" as abbreviation.

Let's read carefully:\n\n\"assessment of the patient's depressive symptoms, using a structured interview and defined anchor points. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale aims to quantify the degree of depression in patients who already have a diagnosis of major depression. Score ranges from 0-52. Higher score indicates greater severity of depression.;\\nThis is a brief (16-item) clinician-rated inventory of core depressive symptoms such as sleep, depressed mood, appetite, concentration, suicidal ideation, interest, energy, psychomotor retardation or agitation. Scores range from 0-27, higher scores indicating greater depression severity.\"\n\nIt seems like maybe describing two different versions: one 17-item? But second says brief 16-item inventory. Could be referring to \"Hamilton Depression Rating Scale\" again but maybe a shortened version? Might be \"Brief Hamilton Depression Rating Scale\"? Usually abbreviated \"B-HAMD\". But the text doesn't give an acronym. So we should extract markers: \"Hamilton Depression Rating Scale\" with its scoring ranges. Also maybe \"Brief Hamilton Depression Rating Scale\" but it's not named. The text says \"brief (16-item) clinician-rated inventory\". That might be a separate marker: \"Brief Hamilton Depression Rating Scale\" but not explicit acronym. According to rule: If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form. So we could use \"B-HAMD\" or \"Brief HAMD\". But we need to ensure we don't invent beyond what's present. The text does not provide an acronym. But we can still create abbreviation. However, the instruction: \"Extract acronyms from text even if they appear in parentheses after full names.\" There is no acronym. So we might just list \"Hamilton Depression Rating Scale\" twice? No duplicates collapsed. So we list one marker: \"Hamilton Depression Rating Scale: Clinician-rated inventory of core depressive symptoms\".\n\nBut there are two different scoring ranges: 0-52 and 0-27. Which one to capture? Maybe we note both? But marker is same instrument. We can mention the scoring ranges in description. Provide one entry.\n\nThus markers array: ['HAM-D: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale']? Wait acronym: HAM-D is common. But text didn't say HAM-D. But we can use \"HAM-D\" as acronym? The instructions: \"If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form.\" So we can use \"HAM-D\". Good.\n\nSo output:\n\nanalysis: 4-5 sentences referencing evidence.

Actually earlier example had \"Hamilton rating scale\". Here it's generic. Might be \"Hamilton Depression Rating Scale\" but not specified. Let's list as \"Provider Administered Questionnaire: Depression Remission Assessment\" maybe? But we should use acronym if present. None given. So we might create abbreviation like \"PRQ: Provider Administered Questionnaire for Depression Remission\".\n\nBut guidelines: Use acronym if available. If none, create logical abbreviation or use shortest recognizable form. So we can use \"PRQ\" or just \"Depression Remission Questionnaire\". Provide expanded form.\n\nNext: \"21 item Self-report measure of depressive symptoms.\" That's likely \"Patient Health Questionnaire-9\"? Wait 21 items self-report measure is \"PHQ-9\" is 9 items. 21 items self-report is \"Beck Depression Inventory-II\" (BDI-II) is 21 items. So we can call BDI-II. Acronym BDI-II: Beck Depression Inventory II. Good.\n\nNext: \"suicidal ideation rating scale created by researchers at Columbia University. The score was calculated by summing the answers to 5 questions. Score range - 0 to 5.\" That is \"Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\" (C-SSRS) but that's 5 items? Actually C-SSRS has 5 items for ideation. So acronym C-SSRS. We'll use \"C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\".\n\nNext: \"6 item questionnaire used to score the severity of depression. Scale range - 0 to 22.\" That's \"Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology – Self Report (QIDS-SR)\" is 16 items. 6 items is \"PHQ-2\" but 2 items. Maybe \"PHQ-6\"? There is \"PHQ-6\" but not common. Could be \"Brief Mood Questionnaire\"? Hmm. But we can still name as \"Six Item Depression Severity Questionnaire\" abbreviation \"6IDSQ\". But guidelines say use acronym if available. Since not known, we can create abbreviation \"6IDSQ\". Provide expanded form.\n\nNext: \"ten item diagnostic questionnaire used to measure severity of depressive symptoms in patients with mood disorders. Scale range 0 to 60.\" That's \"Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ)\" is 13 items. Ten items maybe \"Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)\"? Not sure. Could be \"DSM-IV Axis I Depression Screening\" etc. But we can treat as \"Ten Item Depression Diagnostic Questionnaire\" abbreviation \"10IDDQ\".\n\nThere are two identical lines for same 10 item questionnaire. So duplicate removed.\n\nThen: \"Within subject changes in resting state functional connectivity of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) to default mode network (DMN).\" That's a neuroimaging marker: \"Resting-state Functional Connectivity (rsFC) between sgACC and DMN\". Technique: fMRI. So marker: \"rsFC sgACC-DMN: Resting-state functional connectivity between subgenual ACC and Default Mode Network\".\n\nAlso mentions specific DMN nodes: fDMN, mDMN, lDMN, rDMN. Could list each connectivity? Probably just overall connectivity.\n\n\"T-statistic (T-score)\" is statistical metric, not a marker.\n\nThen: \"Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT-DR). Score range 0 to 72.\" That's a cognitive test. Marker: \"HVLT-DR: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised\".\n\n\"Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Revised (BVMT-DR).\" Marker: \"BVMT-DR: Brief Visuospatial Memory Test – Revised\".\n\n\"Digit Span test and various tests from the Delis Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) will be used to assess possible cognitive side-effects.

They are the scales themselves. Should we include subscales? The instruction: markers are quantitative criteria and features used to diagnose depression or evaluate symptoms.

Use acronym if available. For Meaning of Life Questionnaire, acronym? None given. Could use MLQ. But rule says if no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form. So we can use MLQ. For BDI already acronym. For Psychache Scale, acronym PS? Might use PS.
