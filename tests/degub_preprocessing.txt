A scale used to quantify the severity of symptoms of dementia. The CDR-SB is obtained through interviews of patients and informants, and disease severity is rated in 6 domains of functioning: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain is rated on a 5-point scale of functioning as follows: 0, no impairment; 0.5, questionable impairment; 1, mild impairment; 2, moderate impairment; and 3, severe impairment (personal care is scored on a 4-point scale without a 0.5 rating available). The CDR-SOB score is obtained by summing each of the domain box scores, with scores ranging from 0 to 18, with the higher values representing more severe impairment.;

Values are standard deviations centered on a pooled baseline (all participant scores at baseline). Higher values mean improvement over baseline testing. Lower scores (including negative) mean worse performance after baseline testing. There is no minimum or maximum score.;
896372334 - OG001: Executive Function ability to be measured using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). CFA aggregates scores from across multiple subtests. Values are standard deviations centered on a pooled baseline (all participant scores at baseline). Higher values mean improvement over baseline testing. Lower scores (including negative) mean worse performance after baseline testing. There is no minimum or maximum score.;
896372335 - OG000: Executive Function ability to be measured using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). CFA aggregates scores from across multiple subtests. Values are standard deviations centered on a pooled baseline (all participant scores at baseline). Higher values mean improvement over baseline testing. Lower scores (including negative) mean worse performance after baseline testing. There is no minimum or maximum score.;

  outcome_measurement_description: Whole brain volume in mL define by Freesurfer analysis. Higher numbers indicate greater brain volume. There is no defined maximum. Zero is the theoretical minimum.;
Amyloid burden measure is mean Florbetapir cortical-to-cerebellar uptake ratio averaged across 6 regions of interest (frontal, temporal, parietal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus). Higher numbers mean more amyloid accumulation. There is no defined maximum value. Zero is the theoretical minimum value.;
