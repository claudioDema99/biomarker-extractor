A typical reference range is 6-23 micrograms/deciliter (mcg/dL) from blood drawn in the morning. Low levels of cortisol can indicate Addison's disease or a problem with the pituitary gland, while high levels may indicate tumors of the adrenal gland, among other illnesses, or increased stress. Chronic elevation of cortisol is associated with reduced immune function and increased risk of heart disease. IL-2 treatment stimulates the release of cortisol and this stimulation is dose dependent (rising as the dose of IL-2 increases) and tends to increase further with repeated exposure to IL-2. Blood was drawn for measuring cortisol at screening (baseline value) and once during days 1-3 of each cycle of the four IL-2 treatments.;/nThe mean number of IL-2 doses tolerated (out of the possible 60 total doses) are presented for each study arm. The standard high dose regimen of IL-2 includes 15 doses per cycle. The dose of IL-2 is reduced, or treatment is stopped entirely, if the side effects become severe. This analysis includes the total number of doses taken at the end of Cycle 4, by all participants who began the trial, regardless of how many cycles each participant completed.;/nHamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) is a 21-item, observer-rated scale which quantifies the severity of depressive symptoms, including depressed mood, loss of interest in usually pleasurable activities, insomnia, anorexia, fatigue, weight loss, and psychomotor retardation or agitation. Participants rate the severity of their symptoms on a scale of 0-2 or 0-4 (depending on the item), where 0 means that the symptom is absent. Total scores are calculated by summing the first 17 items for a total score between 0 and 50. For this study a score of 0-6 indicates a normal state, a score of 7-17 indicates mild depression, a score of 18-24 indicates moderate depression, and a score of greater than 25 indicates severe depression. The HAM-D was administered at screening (baseline value) and once during days 1-3 of each cycle of the four IL-2 treatments.;/nAdrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is a stress hormone that is synthesized by the pituitary in response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). ACTH stimulates adrenal cortisol production. ACTH levels vary throughout the day and are highest between 6am and 8am. A typical reference range is 10-50 picograms per milliliter (pg/ml) from blood drawn in the morning. Low levels of ACTH can indicate adrenal insufficiency (including adrenal cancers) while high levels may indicate several diseases or stress. IL-2 treatment stimulates the release of ACTH and this stimulation is dose dependent (rising as the dose of IL-2 increases) and tends to increase further with repeated exposure to IL-2. Blood was drawn for measuring ACTH at screening (baseline value) and once during days 1-3 of each cycle of the four IL-2 treatments.;/nImmune system functioning was assessed by measuring plasma concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6). IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine that is elevated during times of inflammation, infection, in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer, and is also implicated in mood disorders.

Remission will be defined as a MADRS score of 10 or less for at least two consecutive assessments. The MADRS will also be used to assess clinical response throughout the trial and to determine final medication dosage. At the end of week 6, those with a MADRS score greater than 10 will have the venlafaxine XR increased from 150 mg/d to a maximum of 300 mg/d.;/nThe battery evaluates several cognitive domains. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 4th ed. Digit Span subtest assesses attention and working memory. The Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) measures Immediate and Delayed Memory, Attention, Language Abilities, and Visuospatial Functioning. Total index scores range from 40-155. The California Verbal Learning Test, 2nd Ed. (CVLT) assesses non-contextual verbal learning and memory. Z-scores are calculated for each of the constructs assessed by the CVLT. Subtests from the Deli-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) assess aspects of executive functioning, including set-shifting (Trail Making Test Conditions 4 and 5: scaled score ranging from 0-19) and inhibition (Color-Word Interference Test Condition 3: weighted scaled score ranging from 1-19). Given that standardized scores are calculated for each of the neuropsychological measures, higher scores always indicate better cognitive functioning.;/nCardiorespiratory fitness was measured via submaximal VO2 on a motorized treadmill while measuring oxygen utilization via Parvo Medics True one metabolic cart. The submaximal test followed a modified Balke protocol in which speed remained constant with the intensity being increased every two minutes via a raise of 2.0% of the incline. The speed was an agreed upon speed between participant and staff (between 2.0 and 4.0 mph). The submaximal VO2 was stopped when participant reached 85% of age predicted maximal heart rate (220 - age), rating of perceived exertion (RPE) equal to or greater than 15 for those who have blunted heart rate response due to beta block medication, or volitional termination by participant. Vital signs were monitored throughout the test and cool down period. Peak VO2 values for this cohort ranged from 14.04 to 36.48 ml/kg/min, with higher values correlated to higher fitness level.;/nThis will be used to acquire objective information about physical activity. This armband is worn around the upper arm (left triceps) for 1 week and collects information about skin temperature, galvanic skin response, heat flux, and motion via a 3-axis accelerometer. This information is used in an algorithm to determine energy expenditure (EE). The device has a resolution of 1-minute indicating that we can acquire the above information on a minute-by-minute basis, which will allow us to determine both duration and intensity of activity during a normal week. Higher values indicate higher levels of activity.;'}

The Average Concentration (Cavg) that is the average drug level over a 28-day period. Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) that is how long it takes for the drug to reach its peak concentration. Area Under the Curve (AUC) the total amount of drug exposure over a specific period. Accumulation Index (Rac) that is how much the drug levels build up in the body after multiple doses. It's calculated by comparing the AUC and Cmax of the third injection to the first where a value greater than 1 indicates drug accumulation. Fluctuation and Swing are markers to measure the stability of drug levels, showing the difference between the maximum and minimum concentrations. To characterize the efficacy of the RBP-7000 multiple psychitric markers are adopted, such as: the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) that measures the severity of symptoms (i.e.: hallucinations and emotional withdrawal) and the Clinical Global Impression scales - clinically administrered by physicains - that provide an overall assessment of a patient's illness severity (CGI-S) and change (CGI-C). This record also reports for potential side effects, a critical part of any drug study, proposing different markers such as: the Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) to document any health problems that occurred after the treatment begins; Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) to monitor for tardive dyskinesia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive body movements; Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) to assess for drug-induced Parkinsonism symptoms like rigidity and tremors; Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) to asseess for akathisia, a feeling of inner restlessness; the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) to systematically track any suicidal thoughts or behaviors.', 'markers':['Cmax:  Maximum Concentration','Cmin: Minimum Concentration','Cavg: Average Concentration','Tmax: Time to Maximum Concentration','AUC: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve','Rac: Accumulation Index','Fluctuation: (Cmax-Cmin)/Cavg','Swing: (Cmax-Cmin)/Cmin','PANSS: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale','CGI-S: Clinical Global Impression of Severity','CGI-C: Clinical Global Impression of Change','AIMS: Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale','SAS: Simpson-Angus Scale','BAS: Barnes Akathisia Scale','C-SSRS: Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale','TEAEs: Number of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events']}

MARKERS DEFINITION: The markers are the quantitative criteria and features (biological, molecular, clinical, imaging, histological, genetical) that are used to diagnose {name}'s disease or to evaluate pathological symptoms and conditions related to {name}'s disease.            
            
Your task: analyze the provided records and extract ONLY markers explicitly present in the text. Do NOT invent markers not present in the records. You have to include techniques or modalities, but only if a marker extracted from these techniques is explicitly present in the text. Example: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a technique, include it if hippocampal volume (or another quantity extracted from MRI) is present as a marker; Electromiography (EMG) is a technique, include it if affect-modulated startle (AMS) or startle eye-blink is present in the text as a marker. 

MANDATORY OUTPUT RULES (must be followed exactly):
1. Output **exactly one** JSON object and nothing else (no surrounding text, no code fences). The JSON must have two keys:
{{"analysis": "<4-5 concise sentences>", "markers": [list of marker with required syntax]}}
2. "analysis" must be a single string of 4–5 sentences that reference the evidence in the records.
3. "markers" must be a JSON array. Each element in the array MUST follow this exact syntax:
"ACRONYM: expanded form of the acronym (or brief description if no acronym exists)"
**CRITICAL**: ALWAYS use the ACRONYM (in UPPERCASE) before the colon when available. Extract acronyms from text even if they appear in parentheses after full names. If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form.

4. Collapse duplicates (each marker appears once).
