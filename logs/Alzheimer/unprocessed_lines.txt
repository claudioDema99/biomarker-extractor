<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The record describes analytical limits for immunoglobulin assays and definitions of adverse event categories. It specifies the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) values for IgG (100 U/mL) and IgM (50 U/mL) and how values below LLOQ are handled. It also defines key safety markers: adverse events (AE), treatment‑emergent adverse events (TEAE), and serious adverse events (SAE). No clinical or biomarker measurements beyond these are mentioned. Therefore the relevant markers are the LLOQ thresholds for IgG and IgM and the AE classifications.<|return|>

{"analysis":"The record enumerates a comprehensive set of Alzheimer’s disease markers spanning clinical scales, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma biomarkers, and neuroimaging readouts. Key clinical instruments include the EQ‑5D, VAS, ADAS‑Cog series (11, 12, 14), ADCS‑ADL, NPI, CDR‑SB, MMSE, and a quality‑of‑life questionnaire (QoL‑AD). Biomarker concentrations of amyloid‑beta 1‑42 in plasma and spinal fluid, phosphorylated tau and total tau in spinal fluid are explicitly reported. Imaging markers comprise PET SUVR values for amyloid ([18F]‑AV‑45) and glucose metabolism (18F‑FDG) as well as volumetric hippocampal measurements by vMRI.","markers":["EQ-5D: EuroQol Five Dimensions","VAS: Visual Analog Scale","Aβ-P: Amyloid Beta 1-42 in Plasma","Aβ-SF: Amyloid Beta 1-42 in Spinal Fluid","ADAS-Cog12: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 12","ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-C

<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The record describes PET‑based amyloid imaging quantified as standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) at baseline, 12 months and 24 months.  It uses a BAPL scoring system (1 = normal/negative, 2–3 = abnormal/positive) to classify scans and compares these scores to clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer’s disease.  Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV are calculated from the BAPL classifications versus the eventual AD diagnosis.  The markers explicitly listed are the SUVR values, the BAPL score, and the diagnostic performance metrics (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV).<|return|>
