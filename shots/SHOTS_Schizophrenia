   {'analysis':'This is a summary of a genetic study investigating the inheritance of a trait called P50 sensory gating. The study used two main metrics (Heritability Coefficient ("h squared"), Log of the ODDS of Linkage) to explore the relationship between this trait and a specific gene (i.e.: Genetic Linkage). Genetic linkage: The biological phenomenon where genes that are physically close to each other on a chromosome tend to be inherited together during meiosis. It is a concept to be proven./nHeritability Coefficient (h squared): This is the first metric that estimates the proportion of a trait's variation that is due to genetic differences. In this clinical trial record, an "h squared" value between 0 and 1 is used to determine how much of the variation in "P50 sensory gating" is inherited. A higher value (closer to 1) suggests a stronger influence on the trait (i.e.: P50 sensory gating is inherited)./nLog of the Odds (LOD) Score: This is a statistical measure used to see if a gene and a trait are located close to each other on a chromosome and are therefore likely to be inherited together. The study used a statistical analysis to calculate a LOD score, which is the logarithm of the odds that the gene for the "alpha7 nicotinic receptor" and "P50 sensory gating" are linked versus not linked. A higher LOD score (typically 3.0 or greater) provides strong evidence that the gene and the trait are linked.', 'biomarkers':['h squared: Heritability Coefficient','Log of the Odds Score: LOD Score']}

The Average Concentration (Cavg) that is the average drug level over a 28-day period. Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) that is how long it takes for the drug to reach its peak concentration. Area Under the Curve (AUC) the total amount of drug exposure over a specific period. Accumulation Index (Rac) that is how much the drug levels build up in the body after multiple doses. It's calculated by comparing the AUC and Cmax of the third injection to the first where a value greater than 1 indicates drug accumulation. Fluctuation and Swing are markers to measure the stability of drug levels, showing the difference between the maximum and minimum concentrations.
