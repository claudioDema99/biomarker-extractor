We should list them with acronym: expanded form.\n\nFrom first record:\n\n- CERAD-K: Korean version of Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease. It's a test battery. So biomarker: CERAD-K: Korean version of Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (test battery).\n\n- NPI: Neuropsychiatry Inventory? Actually \"Neuropsychiatry Inventory (NPI)\" maybe typo; it's Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Use NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory.\n\n- GDS-K: Geriatric Depression Scale-Korean. So GDS-K: Geriatric Depression Scale-Korean.\n\nAlso within CERAD-K details: Boston Naming Test, Mini-Mental State Examination (Korean version), Word List Memory, etc. But these are subtests. Are they considered biomarkers? They are measurement tools. Should we include them? The instruction says extract biomarkers explicitly present. The example includes only main tools like ADAS-Cog, MMSE, etc. They didn't include subcomponents like Boston Naming Test separately. So likely only main instruments: CERAD-K, NPI, GDS-K. Also mention \"Mini-Mental State Examination\" but that's part of CERAD-K. But could be separate biomarker? In previous examples, they included MMSE as separate when mentioned. Here, \"Mini-Mental State Examination in the Korean version of CERAD Assessment Packet\". That might count as MMSE. But it's within CERAD-K. However, the record lists \"Mini-Mental State Examination in the Korean version of CERAD Assessment Packet (0-30).\" That's a specific instrument. Could be considered biomarker. But earlier example had MMSE as separate because it was explicitly mentioned. Here it's also explicitly mentioned. So include MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination.\n\nAlso \"Boston Naming Test\" is a test. Might be considered biomarker. But maybe too granular. The rule: \"extract biomarkers explicitly present in the text.\" So yes, Boston Naming Test is present. But examples didn't break down into subtests. But they did include ADAS-Cog/11 as a biomarker. That's a subcomponent of ADAS-Cog. So maybe we should include subtests. But risk of many entries. Let's see guidelines: \"Each element in the array MUST follow this exact syntax... Always use the ACRONYM (in UPPERCASE) before the colon when available. Extract acronyms from text even if they appear in parentheses after full names. If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form.\"\n\nThus for each test, we need acronym. For Boston Naming Test, acronym is BNT. Not given but we can create. For Word List Memory, WLM? But maybe not needed. Probably keep main ones.\n\nBetter to include: CERAD-K, NPI, GDS-K, MMSE, Boston Naming Test (BNT), Word List Memory (WLM?), Construction Praxis (CP?). But maybe too many.\n\nGiven examples, they included only major instruments. I'd include CERAD-K, NPI, GDS-K, MMSE. Also maybe \"Trail Making Test A and B\" but acronym TMT-A/B. But maybe skip.\n\nSecond record:\n\nBiomarkers:\n\n- Serum Bapineuzumab concentrations: Bapineuzumab concentration. Acronym: Bapineuzumab? No acronym. Use BAPINEUZUMAB: Serum Bapineuzumab concentration.\n\nBut we need acronym uppercase.

So biomarkers: CIBIC+, ADCS-ADL, SIB, MMSE. Also maybe \"Modified CIBIC+\"? But acronym is CIBIC+. Use \"CIBIC+: Clinical Interview-Based Impression of Change plus\". Provide expansion. For ADCS-ADL: \"Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living\". SIB: \"Simpson–Angus? Actually SIB stands for Severe Impairment Battery.\" We can expand as \"Severe Impairment Battery\". MMSE: \"Mini-Mental State Examination\".\n\nRecord 2: Outcome measurement titles mention GMTs of Anti-A-beta Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM. Biomarkers: GMTs of Anti-Aβ IgG, GMTs of Anti-Aβ IgM. Acronym: IgG, IgM. Also \"Anti-A-beta Immunoglobulin G\" could be \"Anti-Aβ IgG\". Provide expansions. Also \"Geometric Mean Titers\" is a metric. But we treat as biomarker? It's a measurement of antibody titers. So yes. So biomarkers: GMT: Geometric Mean Titer? But we need acronym. Could use \"GMT: Geometric Mean Titer\". But it's not an acronym in text. The instruction says always use acronym if available. Here \"GMT\" is used. So \"GMT: Geometric Mean Titer\". But we might separate IgG and IgM. So \"IgG: Anti-Aβ Immunoglobulin G\", \"IgM: Anti-Aβ Immunoglobulin M\". Also \"GMT: Geometric Mean Titer\" maybe. But the biomarker is the titer itself. Might list \"GMT: Geometric Mean Titer of Anti-Aβ IgG\" etc. But keep simple: \"GMT: Geometric Mean Titer\". And \"IgG: Anti-Aβ Immunoglobulin G\", \"IgM: Anti-Aβ Immunoglobulin M\".\n\nAlso \"Anti-A-beta Immunoglobulin G\" uses hyphen. Expand as \"Anti-Aβ IgG\".

Acronym: hsCRP. Expansion: high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Also \"Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Delayed Recall\" is a test, not a biomarker. But it's a cognitive performance measure. Should we include? It's a test, but still a biomarker? According to definition, a biomarker is a quantifiable characteristic. Cognitive test scores are considered clinical biomarkers. So include \"HVLT-D: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Delayed Recall\"? But acronym not given. We can create abbreviation \"HVLT-D\". But rule: If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form. So we can use \"HVLT-D: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Delayed Recall\". Also \"Posterior Cingulate Cortex Volume\" maybe? But just \"posterior cingulate cortex\" mean changes. That refers to region of interest in MRI. Could call \"PCC: Posterior Cingulate Cortex\". But not an acronym. Create \"PCC: Posterior Cingulate Cortex\". Also \"Regional Cerebral Blood Flow on MRI\" is a measurement. Could use \"rCBF-MRI: Regional Cerebral Blood Flow measured by MRI\".

Also outcome description lists various scales: NPI, visual episodic memory, 11-item ADAS-Cog? Actually description mentions 11-item scale (likely ADAS-Cog 11?), working memory, psychomotor function, etc. So biomarkers: NPI, CogState CPAL, One Back Working Memory, Detection, Identification, Visual Learning, ADAS-Cog 70, ADAS-Cog 75, CGI-I, maybe ADAS-Cog 11? But description says 11-item scale designed to assess severity of cognitive impairments – that's ADAS-Cog 11. Also mention \"visual episodic memory\" but not a standard biomarker name. Could treat as \"Visual Episodic Memory\" but it's not an acronym. Might still count as biomarker? The instruction: \"extract ONLY biomarkers explicitly present in the text.\" So any term that is a biomarker. The description includes \"CGI-I\". Also \"working memory\" but not a named instrument. Probably we should include only named instruments: NPI, CogState CPAL, One Back Working Memory, Detection, Identification, Visual Learning, ADAS-Cog 70, ADAS-Cog 75, ADAS-Cog 11, CGI-I. Also \"NPI\" appears twice. Also \"CGI-I\" appears. Also \"ADSCog/11\"? In title it's ADAS-Cog 70, 75. There's also \"CGI-I\".\n\nAlso \"Computerized Test Battery for Cognition (CogState)\" is the platform. So we could list \"CogState: Computerized Test Battery for Cognition\". But the tasks are subtests. The biomarker might be \"CogState CPAL\" etc. Use acronym \"CogState\" maybe. But the requirement: \"ACRONYM: expanded form of the acronym (or brief description if no acronym exists)\". For CogState, acronym is CogState. Expanded form: Computerized Test Battery for Cognition.

But it's measuring agreement of visual assessment. Not a biological biomarker. However \"Standard Uptake Value Ratios for Florbetaben Signal\" is a biomarker: SUVR for Florbetaben. So \"Florbetaben SUVR\" maybe. Also \"Florbetaben PET\" itself. Also \"BAPL\" algorithm scores. BAPL is Beta-Amyloid Plaque Load. So \"BAPL: Beta-Amyloid Plaque Load\". Also \"Kappa coefficient\" maybe not a biomarker. But it's a measurement of agreement, not a biological marker. So exclude.\n\nAlso \"Standard Uptake Value Ratio\" is a quantitative measure of tracer uptake. So \"SUVR: Standard Uptake Value Ratio\". But we need acronym: SUVR.

        "cot": "We need to identify biomarkers explicitly present in the records. Biomarkers are quantifiable characteristics. We should look for any biomarker names: CogState Composite Score, ADAS-Cog, ADCS-ADL? Actually first record mentions ADCS-ADL? Wait first record: brief summary says ADCS-ADL. But outcome measurement title lists CogState Composite Score, ADAS-Cog. So biomarkers: CogState Composite Score, ADAS-Cog. Also maybe ADCS-ADL? It's mentioned in brief summary but not in outcomes. Should we include? The instruction: extract ONLY biomarkers explicitly present in the text. That includes any mention. Even if not outcome? Probably yes. But examples: they extracted only those in outcome titles/descriptions. But sometimes brief summary also had ADCS-ADL but not in outcomes. In example 1, brief summary didn't mention ADCS-ADL. Example 4 had ADCS-ADL23 in outcome titles. So likely we consider biomarkers that are explicitly named anywhere. So include ADCS-ADL? But it's not in outcome measurement title or description. However it's in brief summary. Might still count. But safer to include only those clearly used as measurements. The brief summary might just describe study aims, not necessarily measurement. But it's still a biomarker. I think include ADCS-ADL because it's a measurement tool. But check second record: many biomarkers: Tau, pTau181, MMSE, anti-Aβ autoantibodies, whole brain volume, hippocampal volume, ADAS-ADL, CDR-SOB, plasma Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, area under curve, hippocampal glucose metabolism, etc. Many. Need to list unique ones.\n\nAlso note abbreviations: CSF, plasma, etc. But biomarkers: Tau, phosphorylated tau, MMSE, anti-Aβ autoantibodies, whole brain volume, hippocampal volume, ADAS-ADL, CDR-SOB, plasma Aβ1-40, plasma Aβ1-42, area under curve of plasma Aβ1-42, hippocampal glucose metabolism, plasma concentration of anti-Aβ autoantibodies, plasma concentration of Aβ1-40/42, area under curve of plasma anti-Aβ autoantibodies, etc. Also \"Area Under the Curve of Plasma Aβ1-42\" etc.\n\nAlso \"Cerebral glucose metabolism\" measured via FDG-PET.

Use uppercase acronym. For non-acronym, use logical abbreviation or shortest recognizable form. Eg \"CogState Composite Score\" could be \"CogState: CogState Composite Score\". Or \"CogState Composite Score\" itself? But example uses \"CogState Composite Score\" as biomarker? In example 1, they listed \"3MSE: Modified Mini Mental State Exam\". So we need acronym then colon. For CogState Composite Score, acronym is \"CogState\". Provide description \"Composite Score\". So \"CogState: Composite Score\". Similarly \"ADAS-Cog\" -> \"ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\". \"ADCS-ADL\" -> \"ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living\". For other biomarkers: \"Tau\" -> \"Tau: Cerebrospinal Fluid Tau\". \"pTau181\" -> \"pTau181: Phosphorylated Tau at Threonine 181\". \"MMSE\" -> \"MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination\". \"Anti-Aβ Autoantibodies\" -> acronym \"Anti-Aβ-Ab\" maybe? But we can use \"Anti-Aβ-Ab: Anti-Aβ Autoantibodies\". \"Whole Brain Volume\" -> \"WBV: Whole Brain Volume\". \"Hippocampal Volume\" -> \"HV: Hippocampal Volume\". But we need to use acronym if available. There's no standard acronym given. Could use \"HBV\" but unclear. Maybe use \"Hippocampal Volume\" as \"Hippocampal Volume\". But rule: always use acronym if available. If no acronym, create logical abbreviation or use shortest recognizable form. So for \"Whole Brain Volume\" we could use \"WBV\". For \"Hippocampal Volume\" use \"HV\". For \"ADAS-ADL\" we already have. For \"CDR-SOB\" -> \"CDR-SOB: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes\". For \"Plasma Aβ1-40\" -> \"Aβ1-40: Plasma Amyloid Beta 1-40\". For \"Plasma Aβ1-42\" -> \"Aβ1-42: Plasma Amyloid Beta 1-42\". For \"Area Under the Curve of Plasma Aβ1-42\" -> \"AUC-Aβ1-42: Area Under the Curve of Plasma Amyloid Beta 1-42\". For \"Area Under the Curve of Plasma Anti-Aβ Autoantibodies\" -> \"AUC-Anti-Aβ-Ab: Area Under the Curve of Plasma Anti-Aβ Autoantibodies\". For \"Plasma Anti-Aβ Autoantibodies\" -> \"Anti-Aβ-Ab: Plasma Anti-Aβ Autoantibodies\". For \"Cerebral Spinal Fluid Aβ1-40\" -> \"CSF-Aβ1-40: Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid Beta 1-40\". For \"CSF Aβ1-42\" -> \"CSF-Aβ1-42\". For \"CSF Anti-Aβ Autoantibodies\" -> \"CSF-Anti-Aβ-Ab\". For \"CSF Tau\" -> \"CSF-Tau\". For \"CSF pTau181\" -> \"CSF-pTau181\". For \"Cerebral Glucose Metabolism\" -> \"FDG-PET: Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography\". But specific hippocampal metabolism: \"FDG-Hippocampal\" maybe. Use \"FDG-Hippocampal: FDG-PET hippocampal glucose metabolism\". For \"Whole Brain Volume\" we did WBV. For \"Left Hippocampal Volume\" and \"Right Hippocampal Volume\" maybe separate? Could combine as \"Hippocampal Volume\". But we can list \"LH-V: Left Hippocampal Volume\" and \"RH-V: Right Hippocampal Volume\". But simpler: \"Hippocampal Volume\" covers both. But we want uniqueness. Let's list \"LH-V\" and \"RH-V\". But risk of confusion. I'll list \"LH-V: Left Hippocampal Volume\" and \"RH-V: Right Hippocampal Volume\".

        "cot": "We need to identify biomarkers explicitly present in the records. Biomarkers are quantifiable characteristics. We should list all unique biomarkers mentioned. Let's parse each record.\n\nRecord 1:\n\nOutcome measurement titles mention:\n- ADCS-ADL 19-item Version Total Score\n- CIBIC-plus\n- Number of Patients With Adverse Events (AEs)\n- SIB Total Score\n- NPI - 12 Items Version Total Score\n\nDescriptions confirm:\n- ADCS-ADL 19 items version total score (score 0-54)\n- CIBIC-plus (global rating 1-7)\n- SIB (total score 0-100)\n- NPI (total score 0-144)\n\nAlso mentions AEs but that's not a biomarker; it's an adverse event count. But could be considered a biomarker? Usually AE counts are safety outcomes, not biomarkers. The instruction says biomarker is quantifiable characteristic of the body serving as objective indicator of biological processes or pathological conditions. AEs are not necessarily biomarkers. So we likely exclude AEs.\n\nThus biomarkers: ADCS-ADL, CIBIC-plus, SIB, NPI.\n\nCheck if any other biomarker like \"memantine\" itself? No, memantine is a drug, not a biomarker.\n\nSo record 1 yields 4 biomarkers.\n\nRecord 2:\n\nOutcome measurement titles: \n- Correlation of Florbetapir-PET Image and Amyloid Plaque Density\n- Specificity Analysis\n- Regional Correlation Analysis\n\nDescription: Spearman correlation of median semi-quantitative visual read of florbetapir-PET image and amyloid plaque density assessed post-mortem by quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC). Also mentions \"specificity of florbetapir-PET scan\". So biomarkers: Florbetapir-PET image (PET scan), Amyloid plaque density (post-mortem IHC). Also maybe \"semi-quantitative visual read\" but that's a method. The biomarker is the PET image reading. So we list \"Florbetapir-PET: PET imaging of amyloid\" and \"Amyloid plaque density (IHC)\" maybe \"Amyloid plaque density: post-mortem immunohistochemistry\".\n\nAlso \"Spearman's rank order correlation\" is statistical metric, not biomarker.\n\nThus record 2 yields 2 biomarkers.\n\nRecord 3:\n\nSame as record 1 basically but with same set of biomarkers: ADCS-ADL, SIB, CIBIC-plus, NPI, CMAI. Wait record 3 includes CMAI too. Yes, outcome measurement titles include CMAI - Long Form Total Score. Description includes CMAI details. So record 3 adds CMAI.\n\nThus record 3 yields 5 biomarkers: ADCS-ADL, SIB, CIBIC-plus, NPI, CMAI.\n\nBut note duplication across records: ADCS-ADL appears twice, etc. We collapse duplicates.\n\nNow compile unique biomarkers across all three records:\n\nFrom record 1: ADCS-ADL, CIBIC-plus, SIB, NPI\nFrom record 2: Florbetapir-PET, Amyloid plaque density (IHC)\nFrom record 3: CMAI added.\n\nTotal unique: ADCS-ADL, CIBIC-plus, SIB, NPI, CMAI, Florbetapir-PET, Amyloid plaque density.\n\nCheck if any other biomarker: \"Number of Patients With Adverse Events\" maybe not. \"Adverse Events\" not biomarker.\n\nAlso \"Number of Patients With Adverse Events\" might be considered a safety endpoint but not biomarker.\n\nThus 7 biomarkers.\n\nNow we need to format each as \"ACRONYM: expanded form\". For each, we need acronym uppercase before colon. Use acronym if present. For some, we have acronyms: ADCS-ADL, CIBIC-plus, SIB, NPI, CMAI, Florbetapir-PET, Amyloid plaque density doesn't have acronym. We can create abbreviation \"APD\" maybe? But rule: If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form. So for Amyloid plaque density, we can use \"APD\" or just \"Amyloid plaque density\". But we need acronym uppercase before colon. Could use \"APD: Amyloid plaque density\". That seems fine.\n\nSimilarly for Florbetapir-PET, acronym is \"Florbetapir-PET\" already. Expand: \"florbetapir positron emission tomography imaging of amyloid\". Or \"Fluorbetapir PET scan\". We'll write \"Florbetapir-PET: fluorbetapir PET imaging of amyloid\".\n\nFor ADCS-ADL: \"ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory\"\n\nCIBIC-plus: \"CIBIC-plus: Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change-Plus\"\n\nSIB: \"SIB: Severe Impairment Battery\"\n\nNPI: \"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\"\n\nCMAI: \"CMAI: Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory\"\n\nAPD: \"APD: Amyloid plaque density (post-mortem immunohistochemistry)\"\n\nMake sure each entry follows syntax: \"ACRONYM: expanded form of the acronym (or brief description if no acronym exists)\". So for APD, we give expansion.\n\nNow produce analysis: 4-5 concise sentences referencing evidence. Must mention that these are explicitly named tools measuring cognitive, functional, behavioral, imaging, pathology. Provide summary.\n\nLet's craft analysis: \"The records enumerate several validated clinical scales and imaging assays that serve as quantitative indicators of disease status.

Also mention brain boundary shift integral BBSI, hippocampal volume HCV, MRI brain atrophy rate. So biomarkers: COWAT, BBSI, HCV, MMSE. Also maybe \"brain atrophy rate\" but that's derived from BBSI. Use acronyms: COWAT: Controlled Oral Word Association Test; BBSI: Brain Boundary Shift Integral; HCV: Hippocampal Volume; MMSE: Mini Mental State Examination.

Outcome measurement titles: Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study- Clinical Global Impression of Change in Agitation (CGIC); Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI); Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) – Agitation Subscore; NeuroBehavior Rating Scale – Agitation. So biomarkers: CGIC? Actually it's a clinical global impression. It's a tool. Should we include? Yes, earlier examples included CGIC. So list: CGIC: Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study- Clinical Global Impression of Change in Agitation; CMAI: Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory; NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (agitation subscore); NBRS-A: NeuroBehavior Rating Scale – Agitation. Also maybe mention \"NBRS-A\" abbreviation. Use \"NBRS-A\". Good.\n\nAlso mention \"NBRS-A\" as abbreviation. Provide expanded form: NeuroBehavior Rating Scale – Agitation.

So list: ADAS-COG+: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subpart (Extended Version).\n\nRecord 3: Dimebon safety. Outcome: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs). That's not a biomarker. It's an event count. Not a biomarker. So no biomarkers. But maybe \"AE\" is not a biomarker. So empty list for that record.\n\nRecord 4: Bapineuzumab MRI. Outcome: Number of Participants Reporting Clinically Significant Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Findings. So biomarker: MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Also maybe \"Clinically significant MRI findings\" but just MRI. So list: MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging.\n\nRecord 5: PF-04447943. Many outcomes: Vital signs abnormalities, ADAS-Cog 70, NPI total score, CGI-I, ECG abnormalities, physical exams, C-SSRS, Lab test abnormalities. Which are biomarkers? Vital signs (blood pressure) could be considered biomarker. But typical biomarker definition: quantifiable characteristic. Blood pressure is a physiological measurement. Could be considered. But examples didn't include vital signs. But we might include \"BP\" or \"SBP\" etc. But the instruction says identify biomarkers explicitly present. So yes, vital signs abnormalities are listed. But are they considered biomarkers? Possibly yes. But we need to decide. The example didn't include vital signs. But we can still include them because they are measurements. But risk of over-listing. Let's see guidelines: \"biomarker is a quantifiable characteristic of the body that serves as an objective indicator of biological processes or pathological conditions in Alzheimer's disease.\" Vital signs are indicators of physiological status, not necessarily AD pathology. But they are part of safety monitoring. Might still be considered biomarker. But safer to include only those clearly linked to AD: ADAS-Cog 70, NPI total score, CGI-I, ECG abnormalities, C-SSRS, Lab test abnormalities. But ECG abnormalities are cardiac, not AD. But still a biomarker of safety. But the question likely expects inclusion of all measurement tools. In previous examples, they included clinical scales. So include all measurement tools: ADAS-Cog 70, NPI, CGI-I, ECG, C-SSRS, Lab test abnormalities. Also vital signs. But maybe too many. But we need to collapse duplicates across records. So compile unique list.\n\nLet's list all biomarkers found across all records:\n\nFrom Record1:\n- CGIC: Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study- Clinical Global Impression of Change in Agitation\n- CMAI: Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory\n- NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (agitation subscore)\n- NBRS-A: NeuroBehavior Rating Scale – Agitation\n\nRecord2:\n- ADAS-COG+: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subpart (Extended Version)\n\nRecord4:\n- MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n\nRecord5:\n- SBP: Systolic Blood Pressure (maybe)\n- DBP: Diastolic Blood Pressure\nBut maybe we skip vital signs.\n\n- ADAS-Cog 70: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 70\n- NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (total score)\n- CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression – Improvement\n- ECG: Electrocardiogram\n- C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\n- Lab Tests: Laboratory Test Abnormalities (but we can list \"Lab Tests\" as biomarker? Maybe \"Laboratory Tests\" generic. But we can list \"Lab Tests\".\n\nAlso \"Physical Examination\" maybe not.\n\nBetter to keep only clear measurement tools: ADAS-Cog 70, NPI, CGI-I, ECG, C-SSRS, Lab Tests.\n\nNow check duplicates: NPI appears twice but with different subscales. Keep one entry: NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory.\n\nSimilarly, ADAS-Cog appears as ADAS-COG+ and ADAS-Cog 70. They are different versions. Keep separate entries: ADAS-COG+: Extended version; ADAS-Cog 70: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 70.\n\nAlso \"MRI\" appears once.\n\nAlso \"CGIC\" appears once.\n\nAlso \"CMAI\" once.\n\nAlso \"NBRS-A\" once.\n\nAlso \"ECG\" once.\n\nAlso \"C-SSRS\" once.\n\nAlso \"Lab Tests\" maybe ambiguous. But we can list \"Lab Tests: Laboratory test abnormalities\" but maybe not needed.\n\nVital signs: SBP, DBP. But maybe not.\n\nGiven the instruction: \"extract ONLY biomarkers explicitly present in the text.\" So if vital signs are described, they are present. So we should include them. But we need to use acronym. For SBP and DBP, we can use \"SBP: Systolic Blood Pressure\" and \"DBP: Diastolic Blood Pressure\". Also \"Standing SBP\" etc. But we can just include SBP and DBP.\n\nAlso \"Standing SBP\" maybe separate but we can ignore.\n\nAlso \"Orthostatic Hypotension\" but not a biomarker.\n\nThus list:\n\n- CGIC: Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study- Clinical Global Impression of Change in Agitation\n- CMAI: Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory\n- NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (agitation subscore)\n- NBRS-A: NeuroBehavior Rating Scale – Agitation\n- ADAS-COG+: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subpart (Extended Version)\n- MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n- SBP: Systolic Blood Pressure\n- DBP: Diastolic Blood Pressure\n- ADAS-Cog 70: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 70\n- CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression – Improvement\n- ECG: Electrocardiogram\n- C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\n- Lab Tests: Laboratory Test Abnormalities\n\nCheck duplicates: NPI appears twice but we keep one. ADAS-Cog appears twice but we keep two separate entries.\n\nNow produce analysis sentence referencing evidence. Must be 4-5 sentences.

Let's go through each record:\n\nRecord 1: Brief summary mentions \"phosphorylated tau\", \"glutamate\", \"N-acetylaspartate (NAA)\". Outcome title: \"N-acetylaspartate\". Description: NAA/Cr ratio. So biomarkers: phosphorylated tau? It's mentioned as a finding but not necessarily outcome. But it's a biomarker. Also glutamate. Also creatine? Not sure. Creatine is internal standard. But we should include biomarkers explicitly present. The instruction: identify biomarkers explicitly present in the records. So include all biomarkers referenced. That includes phosphorylated tau, glutamate, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr) maybe. But creatine is used as internal standard; still a biomarker? It's a metabolite measured. Might include. But we need to be careful: The example didn't include internal standards unless explicitly used as biomarker. In example 3, they included NRI as biomarker because it's a metric. So we can include NAA/Cr ratio? But that's a derived biomarker. Should we list NAA/Cr ratio? The biomarker is NAA/Cr ratio. But the requirement: \"ACRONYM: expanded form of the acronym (or brief description if no acronym exists)\". So we could list \"NAA/Cr: N-acetylaspartate to creatine ratio\". But the acronym is NAA/Cr. Acceptable? Maybe just \"NAA/Cr: N-acetylaspartate to creatine ratio\".\n\nAlso mention \"phosphorylated tau\" but no acronym. Could use \"pTau: phosphorylated tau\". Use uppercase pTAU? Usually p-Tau. We'll use \"pTau: phosphorylated tau\". Glutamate: \"GLUT: glutamate\". Creatine: \"Cr: creatine\". But we need to check if creatine is explicitly mentioned. Yes: \"creatine (Cr) also measured by MRS\". So yes.\n\nRecord 2: Outcome measurement: TEAEs. Biomarker: TEAE? It's adverse event count. So \"TEAE: Treatment Emergent Adverse Event\". That's a biomarker of safety.\n\nRecord 3: Many safety outcomes: abnormal vital signs, lab values, ECG findings, AEs. Biomarkers: \"Vital signs\", \"Laboratory values\", \"ECG findings\", \"Adverse Events\". But we need acronyms. Vital signs no acronym. Lab values no acronym. ECG: \"ECG: electrocardiogram\". AEs: \"AE: Adverse Event\". TEAEs already covered. But we can list \"ECG: electrocardiogram\", \"AE: Adverse Event\". Also \"BP: blood pressure\"? But not acronym. But \"BP\" appears. We could include \"BP: blood pressure\". But is that a biomarker? It's a measurement. Probably yes. But the record lists \"absolute systolic blood pressure (BP) values\". So include \"BP: blood pressure\". Also \"HR: heart rate\" appears. Include \"HR: heart rate\". Also \"QTcF\" appears. That's \"QTcF: QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula\". Also \"PR interval (int)\" etc. But maybe too many. But we should capture all biomarkers explicitly present. However, the rule says collapse duplicates. We can include many. But keep concise. But we need to ensure we don't exceed typical length. But okay.\n\nBut maybe we should focus on main ones: TEAE, AE, ECG, BP, HR, QTcF.

Keep one. Use \"pTau\" as acronym. For T-tau, use \"T-tau\". For P-tau, we already have pTau. But maybe keep both? But duplication: pTau covers phosphorylated tau. So remove P-tau entry.\n\nAlso \"beta-amyloid-42\" acronym Aβ42. \"beta-amyloid-40\" Aβ40.\n\nNow produce analysis sentence referencing evidence. Need 4-5 sentences. Summarize.\n\nLet's craft analysis: mention that first record shows biochemical markers via MRS: NAA, glutamate, phospho-tau, creatine ratio. Second record uses TEAE.

So biomarkers: ADCS-CGIC, NPI-12, ADCS-ADL-SIV, SIB. Are there any other? No.\n\nRecord 2: Radiotracer [18F]MK-3328 PET. Biomarkers: [18F]MK-3328 SUVR (Standard Uptake Value Ratio). Also mentions Effective Dose, Organ Effective Dose, etc. But those are radiation metrics, not necessarily biomarkers of disease. However they are explicit measurements. Should we include them? The instruction: \"identify biomarkers explicitly present in the text.\" Biomarkers are quantifiable characteristics indicative of biological processes or pathological conditions in AD. Effective dose is radiation exposure, not disease biomarker. So likely exclude. Focus on disease-related biomarkers: [18F]MK-3328 SUVR, maybe also \"tissue TACs\"? Not a biomarker. So include \"[18F]MK-3328 SUVR\". Also \"Posterior cingulate gyrus SUVR\" is same concept. We should list \"[18F]MK-3328 SUVR: Standard Uptake Value Ratio of [18F]MK-3328\". Also maybe \"SUVR\" alone? Use acronym SUVR. Provide expansion: Standard Uptake Value Ratio. Good.\n\nAlso \"Radiation Exposure\" not disease biomarker. So skip.\n\nRecord 3: Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of Anti-Aβ Immunoglobulin G (IgG). That's a biomarker: GMTs of anti-Aβ IgG. Also \"Anti-Abeta Immunoglobulin G (IgG)\" is the biomarker. So include \"GMT: Geometric Mean Titers\" maybe? But the biomarker is the antibody titer. Use \"GMT: Geometric Mean Titers\". And \"Anti-Aβ IgG\" maybe separate? The biomarker is the antibody level. Could list \"Anti-Aβ IgG: Anti-amyloid beta immunoglobulin G\". But the title says \"Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of Anti-A-beta Immunoglobulin G (IgG)\". So we could list \"GMT: Geometric Mean Titers of Anti-Aβ IgG\". But the requirement: each element \"ACRONYM: expanded form\". So we need an acronym. \"GMT\" is acronym. Expand: Geometric Mean Titers. But we might want to specify it's of Anti-Aβ IgG. Maybe \"GMT: Geometric Mean Titers (of Anti-Aβ IgG)\". That seems okay.\n\nAlso \"Anti-Aβ IgG\" itself has acronym IgG. But that's generic. Might include \"IgG: Immunoglobulin G\". But it's not specific to AD. But still a biomarker? It's part of the measurement. But the biomarker is the titer.

The rule says: \"If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form.\" So we can create \"aβ-IgM Titer\". But we need uppercase.

Let's parse each record.\n\nRecord 1:\n\nBrief summary: exercise, etc. Outcome measurement title lists: Memory Composite; Executive Function Composite; Disability Assessment for Dementia; Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia.\n\nOutcome description describes composites: memory tests, executive function tests, disability measure, depression scale. So biomarkers: Memory Composite, Executive Function Composite, Disability Assessment for Dementia, Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. Are these considered biomarkers? They are composite scores. Yes.\n\nAlso mention \"Logical Memory (Immediate and Delayed)\", \"Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test\". But those are subtests, not necessarily biomarkers. We should list the ones explicitly named in outcome titles. Also maybe \"Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia\" is a scale. So we list those four.\n\nRecord 2:\n\nOutcome measurement title: Reasoning; Verbal Memory; Change in Physical Performance Test; Change in Maximal Oxygen Consumption; Set Maintenance & Shifting; Simple Attention; Visuospatial Processing.\n\nSo biomarkers: Reasoning, Verbal Memory, Physical Performance Test, Maximal Oxygen Consumption (VO2 max), Set Maintenance & Shifting, Simple Attention, Visuospatial Processing. Also note \"Physical Performance Test\" is a test. \"Maximal Oxygen Consumption\" is VO2 max. We'll keep as listed.\n\nRecord 3:\n\nOutcome measurement title: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of LY2886721; Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Effects (Adverse Events); Plasma Concentration of LY2886721: Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC); Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Pharmacodynamic Biomarker Amyloid Beta (Aβ) 1-40 Concentration (Part 2 Only); Pharmacodynamic Biomarker: Plasma Amyloid Beta (Aβ) 1-40 Concentration (Part 1 Only).\n\nThus biomarkers: Cmax of LY2886721, AUC of LY2886721, CSF Amyloid Beta 1-40 concentration, Plasma Amyloid Beta 1-40 concentration. Also \"Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Effects (Adverse Events)\" is not a biomarker but an event count.

But rule says always use acronym if available. If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form.

Let's parse each record.\n\nRecord 1:\n\nOutcome measurement title lists many metrics. Biomarkers likely include:\n\n- Vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure) – but maybe not considered biomarker? It's a physiological measurement. But we can treat as biomarker: \"Pulse Rate\" etc. However typical biomarker definitions include measurable indicators like lab values, imaging, cognitive tests. Vital signs could be considered. But examples earlier didn't include vital signs as biomarkers. They focused on cognitive assessments, imaging, etc. But here vital signs are explicitly listed. Should we include them? The instruction says \"biomarker is a quantifiable characteristic of the body that serves as an objective indicator of biological processes or pathological conditions\". Vital signs fit. So include \"Pulse Rate\" and \"Blood Pressure\"? But we need acronym. For blood pressure, \"BP\" maybe. For pulse rate, \"PR\" maybe. But we need to use acronym if available. Not given. Could create abbreviation: \"PR: Pulse Rate\" and \"BP: Blood Pressure\". But rule: If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form. So yes.\n\nAlso \"Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA)\" – biomarker: \"ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody\".\n\n\"Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)\" – that's a scale, not a biomarker. But it's a measurement tool. Might still be considered biomarker? It's a behavioral assessment. But earlier examples included NPI, ADCS-CGIC etc. So yes include \"C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\".\n\n\"Electrocardiogram (ECG)\" – measurement. Include \"ECG: Electrocardiogram\".\n\n\"DAD\" – Disability Assessment in Dementia. Include \"DAD: Disability Assessment in Dementia\".\n\n\"NPI\" – Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Include \"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\".\n\n\"MMSE\" – Mini-Mental State Exam. Include \"MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination\".\n\n\"ADAS-Cog\" – Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. Include \"ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\".\n\n\"MRI\" – Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Include \"MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging\".\n\n\"Laboratory abnormalities\" – various labs. Specific labs: Hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis. But we can include \"CBC: Complete Blood Count\" maybe? But not acronym given. Maybe just \"Hemoglobin\" etc. But rule: Use acronym if available. None given. We could list \"Hemoglobin: Hemoglobin concentration\". But duplication? Might be too many. Probably focus on main biomarkers: ADA, C-SSRS, ECG, DAD, NPI, MMSE, ADAS-Cog, MRI, Lab parameters? The record mentions \"laboratory abnormalities meeting criteria for potential clinical concern\" but not specific analytes. Could skip.\n\nAlso \"CDR-SB\" – Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes. Include \"CDR-SB: Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes\".\n\nAlso \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Behavioral Symptoms\" already covered.\n\nAlso \"Disability Assessment in Dementia (DAD)\" covered.\n\nAlso \"Potentially Clinically Important Vital Sign Findings\" – includes pulse rate and BP. Already captured.\n\nThus list unique biomarkers: PR, BP, ADA, C-SSRS, ECG, DAD, NPI, MMSE, ADAS-Cog, MRI, CDR-SB.\n\nBut we need to ensure no duplicates across records. Record 2 has different biomarkers.\n\nNow Record 2:\n\nOutcome measurement title includes:\n\n- Cerebral Metabolic Glucose Rate (CMGR) via FDG-PET. Biomarker: \"FDG-PET: Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography\" or \"CMRG: Cerebral Metabolic Glucose Rate\". But acronym given? \"FDG-PET\" is the tracer. We'll use \"FDG-PET: Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography\".\n\n- HMW Adiponectin – biomarker: \"HMW Adiponectin: High Molecular Weight Adiponectin\".\n\n- Executive Function Scale – but that's a test. Include \"Executive Function Scale\" maybe acronym \"EFS\". But not given. Could use \"EFS: Executive Function Scale\".\n\n- ADAS-Cog Subscale – already included earlier but duplicate allowed? Must collapse duplicates across entire set. So ADAS-Cog already present. Keep one entry.\n\n- Global Cognitive Function Tests – but that's a composite. Could call \"Global Cognitive Function\" maybe \"GCF\". But not given. Might skip.\n\n- Also mention \"Peripheral inflammatory biomarkers\" – HMW adiponectin, TNFα, IL-6, hsCRP, FFA. So include TNFα, IL-6, hsCRP, FFA. Acronym: \"TNFα: Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha\", \"IL-6: Interleukin 6\", \"hsCRP: High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein\", \"FFA: Free Fatty Acids\".\n\n- Also \"Genotypes including APOE4 allele\" – biomarker: \"APOE4: Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele\".\n\n- Also \"brain glucose utilization\" measured by FDG-PET. Already captured.\n\n- Also \"Standardized Uptake Value Ratios\" – but that's metric derived from PET.\n\n- Also \"Cerebellum\" reference region.\n\nThus list additional biomarkers: FDG-PET, HMW Adiponectin, EFS, TNFα, IL-6, hsCRP, FFA, APOE4.\n\nAlso \"Executive Function Scale\" maybe not essential but okay.\n\nAlso \"Global Cognitive Function Tests\" maybe not needed.\n\nAlso \"Cerebral Metabolic Glucose Rate\" maybe separate from FDG-PET.

It's a test, but maybe considered biomarker. However instructions: biomarker is quantifiable characteristic. FCSRT is a test measuring memory recall. Could be considered biomarker.

But we can use \"HIPPOC%: Volumetric MRI Hippocampus Volume Percent Change\". But rule: use acronym uppercase before colon. So we need an acronym. We can choose \"HIPPO%\". But simpler: \"HIPPOC%\". But maybe better \"HIPPOC%: Volumetric MRI Hippocampus Volume Percent Change\". Acceptable.\n\nSimilarly \"rsfMRI\" is already uppercase. \"vMRI\" is lowercase but we can use \"VMRI\" or \"vMRI\". Keep \"vMRI\" as acronym? But rule says uppercase. So use \"VMRI\". But we want clarity. Maybe \"VMRI: Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Hippocampus Volume Percent Change\". But we also have other VMRI for whole brain. Let's differentiate: \"VMRI-HIPPO%\" vs \"VMRI-WB\".

Also maybe mention \"ADAS-Cog\" appears twice? Only once. Good.\n\nRecord 2: Outcomes: ADCS-CGIC, ADCS-ADL, NPI, QOL-AD, ADAS-Cog, IADCQ. Also number of infusions temporally associated with AEs/SAEs but that's not a biomarker. So biomarkers: ADCS-CGIC, ADCS-ADL, NPI, QOL-AD, ADAS-Cog, IADCQ. Also maybe \"Infusions temporally associated with AEs\" not biomarker. So six.\n\nRecord 3: Outcome: Number of Adverse Effects. Not a biomarker. No biomarker.

Unique biomarkers: ADAS-Cog, CGIC, ADCS-ADL, ADCS-CGIC, NPI, QOL-AD, IADCQ. Wait ADCS-CGIC vs CGIC? Record1 uses CGIC alone, not ADCS-CGIC. But CGIC is a generic Clinical Global Impression of Change. In record2 it's ADCS-CGIC. Are they separate? They are similar but distinct acronyms. Should treat separately because different names. So include both CGIC and ADCS-CGIC.\n\nAlso ADCS-ADL appears multiple times.

        "cot": "We need to identify biomarkers explicitly present in the records. Biomarkers are quantifiable characteristics. We should list all unique biomarkers mentioned. Let's parse each record:\n\nRecord 1: \n- Plasma Amyloid Beta (Aβ)1-40 and Aβ1-42 concentrations\n- Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) – but that's a test battery, not a biomarker? It's a cognitive measure. But it's a biomarker? According to definition, yes, a quantifiable characteristic. So NTB is a biomarker. \n- Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Amyloid Beta (Aβ)1-40 and Aβ1-42 concentrations\n- Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog)\n- Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB)\n- Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Tau and Phosphorylated Tau (pTau)-181 concentrations\n- Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)\n\nAlso mention \"percent change in plasma concentrations\" etc. So we list biomarkers: PLASMA Aβ1-40, PLASMA Aβ1-42, CSF Aβ1-40, CSF Aβ1-42, CSF Tau, CSF pTau-181, NTB, ADAS-Cog, CDR-SB, MMSE. Also maybe \"Lumbar CSF concentrations\" but same as CSF. Also \"plasma concentrations\" already covered.\n\nRecord 2: Whole Body Radiation Dosimetry – radiation dose values mSv/MBq for various organs. Is that a biomarker? It's a measurement of radiation exposure, not a disease biomarker. Not relevant to AD. Probably not included.\n\nRecord 3: Mean Cortical to Cerebellum SUVR; Precuneus to Cerebellum SUVR. SUVR is a biomarker derived from PET imaging. So \"Cortical to Cerebellum SUVR\" and \"Precuneus to Cerebellum SUVR\". Could treat as \"Cortical SUVR\" and \"Precuneus SUVR\". Might just list \"Cortical to Cerebellum SUVR\" and \"Precuneus to Cerebellum SUVR\".\n\nRecord 4: Florbetapir-PET Scan Quality; Mean Cortical to Cerebellum SUVR. So \"Florbetapir-PET Scan Quality\" is a qualitative metric, but still a biomarker? It's a measure of image quality. Might include. And \"Cortical to Cerebellum SUVR\" again.\n\nRecord 5: Mean Cortical to Cerebellum SUVR. Same.\n\nRecord 6: Agreement of Interpretation Between 30-40 and 50-60 Min Reads - Semi-quantitative Evaluation; Percent Agreement of Interpretation Between 30-40 and 50-60 Min Reads - Qualitative Evaluation. Here the biomarker is \"Amyloid positivity\" read. But the measurement is \"weighted kappa statistic\" and \"percentage agreement\". The underlying biomarker is \"Amyloid deposition\" measured via PET. But the record doesn't explicitly mention amyloid deposition except in the description: \"read each scan and reported the results using a 5-point scale (0=no amyloid; 4=high levels of amyloid deposition).\" So the biomarker is \"Amyloid deposition\" or \"Amyloid PET\". But we might list \"Amyloid PET\" or \"Fluorbetapir PET\". However, the record title mentions \"Interpretation Between 30-40 and 50-60 Min Reads\". The biomarker is \"Amyloid PET read\". I'd include \"Amyloid PET read\" maybe. But we need to use acronym if available. There's no acronym. Use \"Amyloid PET read: amyloid deposition read from PET scan\".\n\nBut earlier records mention \"Florbetapir F 18 (18F-AV-45)\" as tracer. That could be considered a biomarker: \"Florbetapir PET\". But the record itself didn't mention \"Florbetapir\" in the measurement title. But the description says \"three independent readers... read each scan and reported the results using a 5-point scale (0=no amyloid; 4=high levels of amyloid deposition).\" So the biomarker is \"Amyloid deposition\" measured by PET. We'll include \"Amyloid PET: amyloid deposition measured by PET\".\n\nRecord 7: Sensitivity of Florbetapir PET Scans to Detect Moderate to Frequent Amyloid Plaque; Specificity of Florbetapir PET Scans to Detect Moderate to Frequent Amyloid Plaque; Inter-reader Agreement. So biomarker: \"Florbetapir PET\" (amyloid detection). Also \"Moderate to Frequent Amyloid Plaque\" as reference standard. But we list \"Florbetapir PET: amyloid plaque detection\". Also \"Amyloid plaque burden\" maybe. But we keep simple.\n\nNow compile list of unique biomarkers:\n\nFrom Record1:\n- PLASMA Aβ1-40\n- PLASMA Aβ1-42\n- CSF Aβ1-40\n- CSF Aβ1-42\n- CSF Tau\n- CSF pTau-181\n- NTB\n- ADAS-Cog\n- CDR-SB\n- MMSE\n\nFrom Record3-5:\n- Cortical to Cerebellum SUVR\n- Precuneus to Cerebellum SUVR\n- Florbetapir-PET Scan Quality\n(though maybe not a biomarker but okay)\n- Florbetapir PET (from later records)\n- Amyloid PET read\n- Amyloid plaque detection (Florbetapir PET)\n- Amyloid plaque burden? maybe not needed.\n\nAlso \"Weighted Kappa Statistic\" is a statistical measure, not a biomarker.\n\nThus final list:\n\nPLASMA Aβ1-40: Plasma amyloid beta 1-40 concentration\nPLASMA Aβ1-42: Plasma amyloid beta 1-42 concentration\nCSF Aβ1-40: Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta 1-40 concentration\nCSF Aβ1-42: Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta 1-42 concentration\nCSF Tau: Cerebrospinal fluid total tau concentration\nCSF pTau-181: Cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau 181 concentration\nNTB: Neuropsychological Test Battery\nADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale\nCDR-SB: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes\nMMSE: Mini Mental State Examination\nCORTICAL_SUVR: Cortical to Cerebellum Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\nPRECUNEUS_SUVR: Precuneus to Cerebellum Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\nFLORBETAPIR_PET_QUALITY: Florbetapir-PET Scan Quality\nFLORBETAPIR_PET: Florbetapir PET amyloid plaque detection\nAMYLOID_PET_READ: Amyloid PET read (amyloid deposition)\nMaybe combine FLORBETAPIR_PET and AMYLOID_PET_READ into one? But duplicates allowed? Should collapse duplicates. We have FLORBETAPIR_PET and AMYLOID_PET_READ separate. But they represent same concept. We can merge them: \"FLORBETAPIR PET: amyloid plaque detection\". Keep one entry.\n\nAlso \"Cortical to Cerebellum SUVR\" appears multiple times; keep one.\n\nSo final biomarkers list:\n\n- PLASMA Aβ1-40: Plasma amyloid beta 1-40 concentration\n- PLASMA Aβ1-42: Plasma amyloid beta 1-42 concentration\n- CSF Aβ1-40: Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta 1-40 concentration\n- CSF Aβ1-42: Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta 1-42 concentration\n- CSF Tau: Cerebrospinal fluid total tau concentration\n- CSF pTau-181: Cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau 181 concentration\n- NTB: Neuropsychological Test Battery\n- ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale\n- CDR-SB: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes\n- MMSE: Mini Mental State Examination\n- CORTICAL_SUVR: Cortical to Cerebellum Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\n- PRECUNEUS_SUVR: Precuneus to Cerebellum Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\n- FLORBETAPIR PET: Florbetapir PET amyloid plaque detection\n- FLORBETAPIR PET QUALITY: Florbetapir-PET Scan Quality\n\nCheck duplicates: FLORBETAPIR PET appears twice? Only once now. Good.\n\nNow craft analysis sentence referencing evidence. Must be 4-5 sentences. Provide analysis referencing records.\n\nLet's write 4 sentences:\n\n1. The first record lists plasma and CSF amyloid‑beta species (Aβ1‑40 and Aβ1‑42), CSF tau proteins, and neurocognitive scales such as NTB, ADAS‑Cog, CDR‑SB, and MMSE as explicit biomarkers of disease biology and function.  \n2. Subsequent records describe PET‑derived metrics, notably the cortical‑to‑cerebellum and precuneus‑to‑cerebellum SUVRs, and the Florbetapir‑PET scan quality score, all of which quantify amyloid deposition in vivo.  \n3. The latter studies also report reader‑based amyloid PET outcomes—sensitivity, specificity, and inter‑reader agreement—using a 5‑point amyloid scale, underscoring the use of Florbetapir PET as a direct biomarker of plaque burden.  \n4. Together, these documents enumerate a comprehensive set of biochemical, imaging, and cognitive biomarkers that are explicitly named and quantified within the trial protocols.\n\nNeed to ensure 4-5 sentences. That's 4 sentences. Good.\n\nNow produce JSON. Ensure array elements formatted exactly: \"ACRONYM: expanded form\". For acronyms like PLASMA Aβ1-40, we don't have acronym. Use \"PLASMA Aβ1-40\" as acronym? The rule: always use uppercase acronym before colon when available. If no acronym, create logical abbreviation or use shortest recognizable form. So for \"Plasma amyloid beta 1-40 concentration\", we can use \"PLASMA Aβ1-40\" as acronym. Similarly for CSF Aβ1-40. For CSF Tau, use \"CSF TAU\". For CSF pTau-181, use \"CSF PTau-181\". For NTB, use \"NTB\". For ADAS-Cog, use \"ADAS-Cog\". For CDR-SB, use \"CDR-SB\". For MMSE, use \"MMSE\". For CORTICAL_SUVR, use \"CORTICAL SUVR\". For PRECUNEUS_SUVR, use \"PRECUNEUS SUVR\". For FLORBETAPIR PET, use \"FLORBETAPIR PET\". For FLORBETAPIR PET QUALITY, use \"FLORBETAPIR PET QUALITY\".\n\nMake sure each element follows \"ACRONYM: expanded form\". Use uppercase letters. For Greek letter β, keep as β? Might be fine. Use \"Aβ\". Acceptable.\n\nList:\n\n\"PLASMA Aβ1-40: Plasma amyloid beta 1-40 concentration\"\n\"PLASMA Aβ1-42: Plasma amyloid beta 1-42 concentration\"\n\"CSF Aβ1-40: Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta 1-40 concentration\"\n\"CSF Aβ1-42: Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta 1-42 concentration\"\n\"CSF TAU: Cerebrospinal fluid total tau concentration\"\n\"CSF PTau-181: Cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau 181 concentration\"\n\"NTB: Neuropsychological Test Battery\"\n\"ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale\"\n\"CDR-SB: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes\"\n\"MMSE: Mini Mental State Examination\"\n\"CORTICAL SUVR: Cortical to Cerebellum Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\"\n\"PRECUNEUS SUVR: Precuneus to Cerebellum Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\"\n\"FLORBETAPIR PET: Florbetapir PET amyloid plaque detection\"\n\"FLORBETAPIR PET QUALITY: Florbetapir-PET Scan Quality\"\n\nEnsure no duplicates.

So biomarker: amyloid positivity? But we need biomarker names. The biomarker is amyloid status derived from AV-45 scans. Also mention \"AV-45\" maybe? Actually the record says \"brain amyloid scans acquired in previous AV-45 clinical studies\". So AV-45 is a radiotracer. Biomarker: AV-45 (flutemetamol?) Actually AV-45 is florbetaben?

Description lists mean ADAScog, mean PAL etc. So biomarkers: ADAScog, PAL? But PAL is a test, not biomarker. But we consider any quantifiable characteristic. The instruction says biomarker is quantifiable characteristic of body. Cognitive tests are clinical biomarkers. So include ADAScog, PAL. Also mention \"Plasma cytokine changes\" in detailed description. That indicates plasma cytokines as biomarkers. Which cytokines? Not specified. But \"Plasma cytokine changes\" is a biomarker category. Should we list \"Plasma cytokines\"? Might be acceptable.

Radiation dose is a measurement of exposure, not a biological characteristic. Might still be considered. But example 3 had NRI and Florbetapir-18F.

We look at both records.\n\nRecord 1: outcomes mention diagnostic confidence, caregiver self-efficacy, patient management categories, ADAS-Cog 11 total score, patient’s clinical diagnosis. Also mentions florbetapir (18F) PET scan result. So biomarkers: florbetapir (18F) PET scan? It's a biomarker. Also ADAS-Cog 11 score is a cognitive test, qualifies as biomarker. Diagnostic confidence percent maybe not typical biomarker but it's a measurement. But we should list biomarkers explicitly present: \"florbetapir (18F)\" as imaging biomarker. \"ADAS-Cog 11\" as cognitive assessment. Maybe also \"diagnostic confidence\" but that's more outcome variable. But still a quantified measure. However guidelines: biomarker definition: quantifiable characteristic of the body that serves as objective indicator of biological processes or pathological conditions. Diagnostic confidence is subjective. So likely not biomarker. So list: \"Florbetapir-18F: tracer used in PET scans to assess amyloid-beta\". And \"ADAS-Cog 11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\".\n\nAlso maybe \"Fortinsky: Family caregivers' self-efficacy for managing dementia scale\" but that's a psychosocial measure, not biomarker. Not include.\n\nSecond record: many ECG intervals, lab abnormalities, BP, pulse rate, NPI total score, ADAS-cog13, C-CASA mapping. Which are biomarkers? ECG intervals (PR, QTcF, QRS) are physiological measurements. Lab parameters like hemoglobin etc. BP, pulse rate. NPI total score is neuropsychiatric inventory. ADAS-cog13 is cognitive. C-CASA mapping is suicidality classification. So we should list all unique biomarkers: PR Interval, QTcF Interval, QRS Complex, Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate, NPI Total Score, ADAS-cog13, C-CASA event codes? Might treat as biomarker.

We could use short forms. But we need to use acronym uppercase before colon. For example \"Hb: Hemoglobin\". Use standard abbreviations. For each parameter, we need to list. That would be many entries. Is that expected? Possibly yes. But maybe we should limit to main biomarkers: ECG intervals, BP, pulse rate, NPI, ADAS-cog13, C-CASA, lab parameters.

But AEs are adverse events, not biomarker. However ARIA-E/H are imaging biomarkers. Also ATA is antibody formation measurement. So we include ARIA-E: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities Edema/Effusions; ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities Hemorrhage; ATA: Human Anti-Therapeutic Antibody.\n\nAlso mention microbleeds (MBs) but that's part of ARIA-H.

Also FCSRT Free Recall is a cognitive test, but it's a biomarker? It's a cognitive measure. Should include FCSRT Free Recall. Also maybe AEs but not biomarker. We'll include FCSRT Free Recall: Free & Cued Selective Reminding Test- Free Recall.\n\nRecord 3: Outcomes:\n- Change From Baseline at Week 16 in Attention Questionnaire Scores (AQS)\n- Change From Screening at Week 16 in Mini Mental State Exam Scores (MMSE)\n- Change From Baseline at Week 16 in Burden Interview (BI) Scores\n\nThese are cognitive/behavioral scales.

So include \"Cmax: Maximum Concentration\" and \"AUC(0-inf): Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve\".

Keep one. ADASCog/11 vs ADAS-Cog11 same? ADASCog/11 is same as ADAS-Cog11. So we might combine? But they are same instrument. Use one entry \"ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\". Remove ADASCog/11.\n\nAlso \"ADCS-ADL23\" is variant of ADCS-ADL. Might treat as same? It's a specific version. Keep both? But duplication risk. The rule: collapse duplicates. Since ADCS-ADL23 is a specific version of ADCS-ADL, but still distinct? I'd consider same instrument but different version.

Exclude.\n\nAlso \"Injection Reactions and IRRs\" not biomarker.\n\nAlso \"Adverse Events\" not biomarker.\n\nAlso \"Serious Adverse Events\" not biomarker.\n\nAlso \"Time to Progression\" not biomarker.\n\nAlso \"Annualized Rate of Change\" is metric, not biomarker itself.\n\nThus list above.\n\nNeed to ensure each entry uses uppercase acronym before colon. For some, we may need to create abbreviation: e.g., \"API-ADAD: Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease Composite Cognitive Test\". Use hyphen.\n\nFor \"Cerebral Macrohemorrhage\" maybe \"MacroHem: Cerebral Macrohemorrhage\" but no acronym given. We can create \"MacroHem: Cerebral Macrohemorrhage\". But rule: If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form. So \"MacroHem\" fine.\n\nSimilarly for \"Inflation\"? Not needed.\n\nAlso \"Plasma Aβ1-40\" acronym \"Aβ1-40\" but we need uppercase. Maybe \"ABETA1-40\" but that's weird. Use \"Aβ1-40\" but contains Greek letter. Use \"ABETA1-40\" maybe. But we can keep \"Aβ1-40\" as is. But requirement: ACRONYM in UPPERCASE. Greek letter counts? Might be okay. But safer: \"ABETA1-40: Amyloid beta 1-40 plasma concentration\". Similarly \"ABETA1-42\".\n\nBut we already have \"Aβ1-40\" in text. We'll use \"Aβ1-40\" as acronym. But it's not uppercase. But maybe acceptable. But to be safe, use \"ABETA1-40\". But then expansion: \"Amyloid beta 1-40 plasma concentration\". Good.\n\nSame for ABETA1-42.\n\nAlso \"CSF tTau\" acronym \"tTau\" but lowercase. Use \"TTau\". Expand \"Total Tau in cerebrospinal fluid\". Similarly \"pTau\" -> \"PTau\".\n\nAlso \"MRI Brain Atrophy\" acronym \"MRI-Atrophy\" or \"BRA\". Use \"BRA\".

        "cot": "We need to identify biomarkers explicitly present in the records. Biomarkers are quantifiable characteristics. We should list all biomarkers mentioned. Let's parse each record.\n\nRecord 1:\n\nBrief summary mentions amyloid presence, brain structure changes, cognitive ability. Outcome measurement title lists Whole Brain Volume; Amyloid Burden; Executive Function. Description: Whole brain volume in mL defined by Freesurfer analysis. Amyloid burden measure is mean Florbetapir cortical-to-cerebellar uptake ratio averaged across 6 ROIs. Executive Function measured using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) aggregated scores from subtests.\n\nThus biomarkers: Whole Brain Volume (mL), Amyloid Burden (Florbetapir cortical-to-cerebellar uptake ratio), Executive Function (standard deviation units). Also mention Florbetapir tracer. So we could list \"WBV: Whole Brain Volume (mL)\", \"AB: Amyloid Burden (Florbetapir cortical-to-cerebellar uptake ratio)\", \"EF: Executive Function (CFA composite SD)\". But we need to use acronym if available. For Whole Brain Volume maybe WBV? Not given. Could use \"WBV: Whole Brain Volume\". For Amyloid Burden maybe AB? Not given. Use \"AB: Amyloid Burden\". For Executive Function maybe EF. Provide expansions.\n\nAlso mention \"Fluorbetapir\" as tracer. Might consider \"Florbetapir: tracer used in amyloid PET scans\". But it's part of biomarker measurement. The biomarker is the uptake ratio. So we might include \"Florbetapir: tracer used to quantify amyloid burden\".\n\nBut rule: \"Each element must follow syntax: 'ACRONYM: expanded form of the acronym (or brief description if no acronym exists)'\". Must use uppercase acronym before colon. If no acronym exists, create logical abbreviation or use shortest recognizable form. So for Whole Brain Volume, we can use \"WBV\". For Amyloid Burden, \"AB\". For Executive Function, \"EF\". For Florbetapir, acronym \"FBP\"? Actually common abbreviation is FBP? Usually \"Florbetapir\" sometimes abbreviated \"AV45\" or \"Florbetapir\". But we can use \"FBP: Florbetapir\". But we already used AB for amyloid burden. Maybe \"FBP: Florbetapir tracer\". That would be okay.\n\nCheck duplicates: ensure unique.\n\nNow Record 2:\n\nOutcome measurement titles include many: Changes in Stroop Interference Naming; ADAS-cog in AD With Epileptiform Activity; Changes in Executive Function as Measured by the NIH EXAMINER Computer Battery; NIH EXAMINER in AD With Epileptiform Activity; Changes in Epileptiform Events; Changes in ADAS-cog; Changes in Behavior and Level of Disability - ADCS-ADL; Changes in Cognitive Function as Measured by a Virtual Route Learning Test; Standardized Assessments of Clinical Fluctuations -The Clinician Assessment of Fluctuation; Stroop Interference in AD With Epileptiform Activity; Changes in Behavior and Level of Disability - Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI); Changes in Behavior and Level of Disability - ADCS-CGIC; Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB); Standardized Assessments of Clinical Fluctuations - One Day Fluctuation Assessment Scale; Blood Serum Prolactin Level;\n\nDescription includes Stroop Test, ADAS-cog, NIH EXAMINER, M/EEG measuring spikes, ADCS-ADL, virtual navigation test, Clinician Assessment of Fluctuation, One Day Fluctuation Assessment Scale, NPI, ADCS-CGIC, CDR-SOB, Blood samples for LEV and prolactin.\n\nSo biomarkers: Stroop Test (subtasks). We can use \"STROOP: Stroop Test\". ADAS-cog: \"ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\". NIH EXAMINER: \"EXAMINER: NIH EXAMINER Computer Battery\". M/EEG spike count: \"M/EEG: Magnetoencephalogram/Electroencephalogram spike count\". ADCS-ADL: \"ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living\".

ADCS-CGIC: \"ADCS-CGIC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\". CDR-SOB: \"CDR-SOB: Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes\". Blood Serum Prolactin Level: \"Prolactin: Serum prolactin level\". Blood Serum Levetiracetam (LEV) level: \"LEV: Levetiracetam serum level\". Also mention \"Spike Count\" maybe separate but same as M/EEG.\n\nAlso mention \"LEVs\" maybe \"LEV: Levetiracetam\". Provide expansions.\n\nAlso mention \"M/EEG\" acronym. Good.\n\nAlso mention \"Virtual Navigation Test\" maybe \"VNT\". But we already have VRLT. Use \"VRLT\".\n\nAlso mention \"Stroop Interference Naming\" maybe \"STROOP-IN: Stroop Interference Naming\". But we can just use STROOP.\n\nAlso \"Executive Function\" measured by NIH EXAMINER. Already covered.\n\nAlso \"Behavior and Level of Disability\" ADCS-ADL and NPI etc.\n\nAlso \"Blood Serum Prolactin Level\" and \"LEV\".\n\nAlso \"Epileptiform Events\" measured by M/EEG spike count. Covered.\n\nAlso \"Changes in Executive Function\" measured by EXAMINER.\n\nAlso \"Changes in Cognitive Function as Measured by a Virtual Route Learning Test\" covered.\n\nAlso \"Standardized Assessments of Clinical Fluctuations\" covers CAF and ODFAS.\n\nAlso \"Stroop Interference in AD With Epileptiform Activity\" same as Stroop.\n\nAlso \"Changes in ADAS-cog\" same as ADAS-Cog.\n\nAlso \"Changes in Behavior and Level of Disability - ADCS-ADL\" same as ADCS-ADL.\n\nAlso \"Changes in Behavior and Level of Disability - Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)\" same as NPI.\n\nAlso \"Changes in Behavior and Level of Disability - ADCS-CGIC\" same as ADCS-CGIC.\n\nAlso \"Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB)\" same as CDR-SOB.\n\nAlso \"Blood Serum Prolactin Level\" same as Prolactin.\n\nThus compile list.\n\nNeed to avoid duplicates.\n\nNow check first record again: we had WBV, AB, EF, FBP. Are there any other biomarkers like \"Fluorbetapir cortical-to-cerebellar uptake ratio\" that's the same as AB. So fine.\n\nSecond record: we have many. Ensure no duplicates.\n\nList them:\n\nSTROOP: Stroop Test\nADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\nEXAMINER: NIH EXAMINER Computer Battery\nM/EEG: Magnetoencephalogram/Electroencephalogram spike count\nADCS-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living\nVRLT: Virtual Route Learning Test\nCAF: Clinician Assessment of Fluctuation\nODFAS: One Day Fluctuation Assessment Scale\nNPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\nADCS-CGIC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\nCDR-SOB: Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes\nProlactin: Serum prolactin level\nLEV: Levetiracetam serum level\n\nAlso \"Blood Serum Prolactin Level\" maybe duplicate with Prolactin. Good.\n\nAlso \"Blood Serum Levetiracetam Level\" maybe duplicate with LEV.\n\nAlso \"Stroop Interference Naming\" maybe same as STROOP.\n\nAlso \"Executive Function\" measured by EXAMINER, but we already have EXAMINER.\n\nAlso \"Epileptiform Events\" measured by M/EEG spike count.\n\nAlso \"Changes in Behavior and Level of Disability - ADCS-ADL\" same.\n\nOk.\n\nNow combine with first record biomarkers.\n\nFirst record list:\n\nWBV: Whole Brain Volume\nAB: Amyloid Burden\nEF: Executive Function\nFBP: Florbetapir tracer\n\nBut note that \"Executive Function\" also appears in second record as part of EXAMINER. But we keep separate because different context. However duplication: \"Executive Function\" appears as a biomarker in first record (EF). In second record, \"Executive Function\" measured by EXAMINER. That's a different instrument. So we keep both.\n\nNow produce JSON with analysis string referencing evidence.\n\nAnalysis: 4-5 sentences summarizing that the records contain specific biomarkers: imaging volumes, amyloid PET uptake, executive function composites, Stroop, ADAS-Cog, NIH EXAMINER, M/EEG spike counts, ADCS-ADL, VRLT, CAF, ODFAS, NPI, ADCS-CGIC, CDR-SOB, serum prolactin, serum levetiracetam.\n\nMake sure 4-5 sentences.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n\"The first record identifies three quantitative biomarkers: whole‑brain volume measured by FreeSurfer, amyloid burden quantified as the Florbetapir cortical‑to‑cerebellar uptake ratio, and executive‑function scores derived from confirmatory factor analysis. The second record enumerates a broader set of clinical and laboratory biomarkers, including the Stroop test, ADAS‑Cog, NIH EXAMINER battery, M/EEG spike counts, ADCS‑ADL, virtual route learning test, clinician and one‑day fluctuation scales, NPI, ADCS‑CGIC, CDR‑SOB, serum prolactin, and serum levetiracetam levels.

For VRM -> VRM. For SWM -> SWM. For PAL -> PAL. For Vital Signs -> VS? Not given acronym. Maybe \"VS: Vital Signs\". For ECG -> ECG. For Safety Laboratory Tests -> S-Lab? But no acronym. Use \"Lab Tests: Safety Laboratory Tests\". But rule says always use acronym if available. No acronym. So just \"Safety Laboratory Tests: Safety Laboratory Tests\".\n\nAlso \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory\"? Already in record 1. Not here.\n\nAlso \"Cognitive Response\" not biomarker.\n\nThus compile list.\n\nNow ensure no duplicates across records. Combine all unique.\n\nList:\n\nMMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination\nMattis Dementia Rating Scale\nKatz BADL: Katz Basic Activities of Daily Living\nPFAQ: Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire\nNeuropsychiatric Inventory\nCornell Scale for Depression in Dementia\nCDR: Clinical Dementia Rating\nFLORTAUCPIR PET: flortaucipir positron emission tomography\nFLORTAUCPIR SUVr: flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratio\nCDR-SB: Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes\nτAD++: Advanced AD tau status\nRVP-A': Rapid Visual Information Processing A prime\nVRM: Verbal Recall Memory\nSWM: Spatial Working Memory\nPAL: Paired Associates Learning\nVS: Vital Signs\nECG: Electrocardiogram\nSafety Laboratory Tests: Safety Laboratory Tests\n\nCheck duplicates: CDR appears twice but keep one.\n\nAlso \"Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)\" already listed. \"CDR-SB\" separate.\n\nMake sure formatting: each element string \"ACRONYM: expanded form\". For ones without acronym, we create abbreviation. Eg \"PFAQ\" for Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire. \"KATZ\" maybe \"BADL\" but we used \"Katz BADL\". Should be \"BADL: Katz Basic Activities of Daily Living\". But acronym is BADL. Use \"BADL: Katz Basic Activities of Daily Living\". Similarly \"PFAQ: Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire\". \"MMSE\" ok. \"NDI\"? Actually \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory\" acronym NPI. Use \"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\". \"Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia\" acronym? \"CSDD\". Use \"CSDD: Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia\". \"CDR\" ok. \"CDR-SB\" ok. \"FLORTAUCPIR PET\" maybe acronym \"FT-PET\". But we can use \"FT-PET: flortaucipir positron emission tomography\". Or \"FLORTAUCPIR PET\". Use \"FLORTAUCPIR PET: flortaucipir positron emission tomography\". \"FLORTAUCPIR SUVr\" use \"FT-SUVr: flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratio\". \"τAD++\" maybe \"TAU++\".

        "cot": "We need to parse each record and list biomarkers explicitly mentioned. Let's go through each record:\n\nRecord 1: \n- PET imaging with florbetapir radioligand measuring brain amyloid load. Biomarkers: Florbetapir PET (radioligand). Also mentions SUVR mapped to centiloid scale. So biomarker: Florbetapir PET (centiloid). Also mentions cortical thickness via MRI, whole brain volume, hippocampal volume, ventricular volume. Those are imaging biomarkers. Also mentions anti-drug antibodies (ADA). That's a biomarker too? It's immunogenicity measurement. But it's a biomarker of immune response. Should we include? The instruction says biomarker is quantifiable characteristic of body serving as indicator of biological processes or pathological conditions in AD. ADA qualifies. So include ADA: Anti-drug antibody. Also mention percent change in cortical thickness etc. But those are outcomes, not biomarkers themselves. But the measurement itself is cortical thickness via MRI. That is a biomarker. Similarly whole brain volume, hippocampal volume, ventricular volume. So include: Cortical Thickness (MRI), Whole Brain Volume (MRI), Hippocampal Volume (MRI), Ventricular Volume (MRI). Also mention SUVR (standardized uptake value ratio) as metric. Could treat SUVR as biomarker. But maybe just Florbetapir PET SUVR. We'll list: Florbetapir PET SUVR (Centiloid). Also mention ADAs. So list: FLORBETAPIR PET: Florbetapir PET imaging of amyloid load; SUVR: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio; Centiloid: Centiloid scale; Cortical Thickness: MRI cortical thickness; Whole Brain Volume: MRI whole brain volume; Hippocampal Volume: MRI hippocampal volume; Ventricular Volume: MRI ventricular volume; ADA: Anti-drug antibody.\n\nBut we should keep consistent naming: Use acronym first. For Florbetapir PET, acronym could be FBP? Not given. We can use \"Florbetapir PET\". No acronym. For SUVR, acronym SUVR. For Centiloid, CL. For Cortical Thickness, CT. For Whole Brain Volume, WBV. For Hippocampal Volume, HV. For Ventricular Volume, VV. For ADA, ADA.\n\nHowever rule: always use acronym uppercase before colon. If no acronym, create logical abbreviation or use shortest recognizable form. So we can use \"FBP PET\" maybe? But not in text. Might risk misinterpretation. Better to use \"Florbetapir PET: Florbetapir PET imaging of amyloid load\". That uses full name as acronym? But requirement: \"ACRONYM: expanded form of the acronym (or brief description if no acronym exists)\". If no acronym, we can use the shortest recognizable form. So \"Florbetapir PET\" is fine. For SUVR: \"SUVR: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\". For Centiloid: \"Centiloid: Centiloid scale\". For Cortical Thickness: \"Cortical Thickness: MRI cortical thickness\". For Whole Brain Volume: \"Whole Brain Volume: MRI whole brain volume\". For Hippocampal Volume: \"Hippocampal Volume: MRI hippocampal volume\". For Ventricular Volume: \"Ventricular Volume: MRI ventricular volume\". For ADA: \"ADA: Anti-drug antibody\".\n\nNow Record 2: flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr). Biomarker: Flortaucipir PET SUVR. So \"Flortaucipir PET: Flortaucipir PET imaging of tau deposition\". And \"SUVR: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\". Maybe also \"Tau deposition\". But that's same as flortaucipir PET. So include those.\n\nRecord 3: Agreement between expert panel and clinical practice reads. Weighted Kappa value. Biomarker: Weighted Kappa? It's a statistical measure, not a biological biomarker. But it's a measurement of agreement. Not a biomarker of disease. So likely exclude. There's no biological biomarker. So no biomarkers.\n\nRecord 4: Cogstate OCL test. Biomarker: OCL (One Card Learning) score. So \"OCL: One Card Learning score\". Also mention arcsine transformed score. But still OCL. So include OCL.\n\nRecord 5: Many cognitive scales: ADAS-Cog, MMSE, ADCS-ADL23, ADCS-CGIC, NPI. Also mention TEAEs. So include ADAS-Cog, MMSE, ADCS-ADL23, ADCS-CGIC, NPI. Also TEAE? TEAE stands for Treatment Emergent Adverse Event. It's a biomarker of safety. Include TEAE. Also mention \"Mini Mental State Examination\" but that's MMSE. Already included. Also \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory\" NPI. So list them.\n\nAlso mention \"TEAE\" acronym. So \"TEAE: Treatment Emergent Adverse Event\".\n\nAlso \"ADAS-Cog\" acronym. \"MMSE\". \"ADCS-ADL23\". \"ADCS-CGIC\". \"NPI\".\n\nAlso \"ADAS-Cog\" is 11-item. Good.\n\nThus compile unique list across all records.\n\nLet's list:\n\n- Florbetapir PET: Florbetapir PET imaging of amyloid load\n- SUVR: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\n- Centiloid: Centiloid scale\n- Cortical Thickness: MRI cortical thickness\n- Whole Brain Volume: MRI whole brain volume\n- Hippocampal Volume: MRI hippocampal volume\n- Ventricular Volume: MRI ventricular volume\n- ADA: Anti-drug antibody\n- Flortaucipir PET: Flortaucipir PET imaging of tau deposition\n- OCL: One Card Learning score\n- ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\n- MMSE: Mini Mental State Examination\n- ADCS-ADL23: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living\n- ADCS-CGIC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\n- NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\n- TEAE: Treatment Emergent Adverse Event\n\nCheck duplicates: None.\n\nEnsure formatting: JSON object with keys \"analysis\" and \"biomarkers\". Provide analysis string 4-5 sentences referencing evidence.\n\nLet's craft analysis: mention that record 1 contains PET imaging with florbetapir, SUVR, centiloid, MRI metrics, ADA. Record 2 has flortaucipir PET SUVR. Record 4 has OCL. Record 5 has multiple cognitive scales and TEAE. Provide 4-5 sentences.\n\nOk.",

It's in brief summary but not explicitly described. Should we include? The instruction says extract biomarkers explicitly present in the text. FAQ is mentioned but not described. It's still a biomarker? It's a tool. Might include. But examples only include ones referenced in outcome measurement titles/descriptions.

Description elaborates on NPI, DEMQOL, CDR, ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, hippocampus atrophy ratio, COWAT, MMSE, SUVR PET.

Biomarkers: florbetapir (18F) scan (PET). Also NRI (Net Reclassification Index) is a statistical metric, but it's a biomarker? It's a measurement of diagnostic accuracy, could be considered a biomarker. But we should include it because it's explicitly referenced. Also maybe \"quantitation software\" but that's not a biomarker. So biomarkers: Florbetapir-18F, NRI.\n\nRecord 2: about conversion of florbetapir SUVr to Centiloid units. Biomarkers: Florbetapir (18F) SUVr, Centiloid units, 11C-PiB SUVr. Also mention \"Cortical average to cerebellum SUVr\". So biomarkers: Florbetapir-18F SUVr, 11C-PiB SUVr, Centiloid units. Maybe also \"SUVr\" itself but that's part of biomarker. We'll list each: FLORBETAPIR-18F: Florbetapir (18F) PET Standard Uptake Value Ratio, 11C-PiB: Pittsburgh Compound B (11C-PiB) PET SUVr, CENTILOID: Centiloid units (standardized amyloid PET metric).\n\nRecord 3: about AZD0530 trial. Biomarkers: CSF Levels of Total Tau, Phospho-tau (p-Tau), Amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta 1-42). Also brain volume change, brain glucose uptake via 18F-FDG PET. Also ApoE genotype. So biomarkers: TOTAL TAU: CSF Total Tau, PHOSPHO-TAU: CSF Phospho-tau, ABETA1-42: CSF Amyloid-beta 1-42, BRN VOLUME: Brain volume change, FDG-PET: 18F-FDG PET brain glucose uptake, APOE GENOTYPE: Apolipoprotein E genotype. Also maybe \"brain FDG-PET imaging\" same as FDG-PET. We'll include.\n\nRecord 4: CPC-201 study. Biomarkers: Donepezil Plasma Concentration, Donepezil MTD. Also TEAEs counts but not biomarker. So biomarkers: DONEPEZIL PC: Donepezil plasma concentration, DONEPEZIL MTD: Donepezil maximum tolerated dose.\n\nRecord 5: Magnesium L-Threonate study. Biomarkers: RBC Magnesium chemistry (magnesium in red blood cells). Also FDG-PET imaging measuring CMRgl (cerebral metabolic rate for glucose). Also maybe \"CMRgl\" itself. Also \"Cognitive function\" tests but those are assessments. But we might consider them as biomarkers too? The instruction says biomarker is quantifiable characteristic. Cognitive tests are quantifiable but are they considered biomarkers? In previous examples, they included ADAS-Cog etc. Yes they did.

Also \"FDG-PET imaging\" is a biomarker. Also \"Cognitive function\" tests: ADAS-COG, MMSE, RBANS, WAIS-IV, DKEFS Color-Word Test, DKEFS Trail 4. Also \"Cognitive function (DKEFS Color-Word Test)\" etc. Also \"Cognitive function (DKEFS - Trail 4)\". Also \"Cognitive Function\" generic but we already captured.

        "cot": "We need to identify biomarkers explicitly present in the records. Biomarkers are quantifiable characteristics. We should list all unique biomarkers mentioned. Let's parse each record.\n\nRecord 1: Many outcomes. Biomarkers:\n\n- Abnormal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings – MRI itself is imaging biomarker. But we need specific biomarker names. \"Abnormal MRI findings\" maybe just MRI. But we could list \"MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging\". However the instruction says use acronym if available. MRI is acronym. So \"MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging\".\n\n- Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) Score – FAQ is a clinical assessment tool, qualifies as biomarker. Acronym FAQ.\n\n- Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Scores – MMSE.\n\n- Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) – TEAE is not a biomarker but an adverse event. Not a biomarker. Should we include? It's not a biomarker. So skip.\n\n- Markedly Abnormal Vital Sign Values – vital signs not a biomarker.\n\n- Plasma Amyloid (A) Beta(1-x) Measurements – biomarker: Plasma Amyloid Beta. Acronym? Could use \"Plasma Aβ\". There's no acronym given. Use \"Plasma Aβ: Plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) measurements\".\n\n- Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Amyloid (A) Beta(1-x) and Abeta(1-42) – biomarker: CSF Aβ. Acronym CSF. So \"CSF Aβ: Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta\".\n\n- Left and Right Hippocampal Volume – biomarker: Hippocampal Volume. Acronym? HV? Not given. Use \"Hippocampal Volume: Left and right hippocampal volume\".\n\n- Whole Brain Volume – biomarker: Whole Brain Volume. Acronym WBV? Not given. Use \"Whole Brain Volume\".\n\n- Total Hippocampal Volume – same as above but total. Might duplicate. Keep one entry \"Total Hippocampal Volume\".\n\n- Total Ventricular Volume – biomarker: Ventricular Volume. Use \"Ventricular Volume\".\n\nAlso mention \"QTcF interval\" – it's a cardiac biomarker. But not necessarily AD biomarker. But still a biomarker. Include \"QTcF: Corrected QT interval (Fridericia's formula)\".\n\nAlso \"TEAE\" etc not biomarker.\n\nThus list: MRI, FAQ, MMSE, Plasma Aβ, CSF Aβ, Hippocampal Volume, Whole Brain Volume, Total Hippocampal Volume, Ventricular Volume, QTcF.\n\nBut check duplicates: Hippocampal Volume vs Total Hippocampal Volume. Both separate. Also Left and Right Hippocampal Volume maybe separate? But we can combine into Hippocampal Volume. But to avoid duplication, keep distinct: \"Left Hippocampal Volume\" and \"Right Hippocampal Volume\"? The record lists percent change in left and right hippocampal volume separately. So we could list \"LH VOLUME: Left hippocampal volume\" and \"RH VOLUME: Right hippocampal volume\". But simpler: \"Hippocampal Volume: Left and right\". But we also have \"Total Hippocampal Volume\". So we can list three: LH, RH, Total. But the instruction: collapse duplicates. So if we list \"Hippocampal Volume\" covers both left/right? Might be ambiguous. I'd list \"Hippocampal Volume: Left and right\" and \"Total Hippocampal Volume\". That seems fine.\n\nAlso \"Whole Brain Volume\" already.\n\nNow Record 2: Urine Analysis - Total Integrated Radioactivity Excreted in Urine. Biomarker: Urinary Total Integrated Radioactivity. Acronym? None. Use \"Urinary Total Integrated Radioactivity\".\n\nRecord 3: Several clinical scales: Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) Z-score, ADCS-ADL, CDR-SB, ADAS-cog11. These are clinical assessment tools. So biomarkers: NTB Z-score, ADCS-ADL, CDR-SB, ADAS-cog11. Acronyms: NTB, ADCS-ADL, CDR-SB, ADAS-cog11. Provide expansions.\n\nAlso \"Neuropsychological Test Battery\" is repeated. So list once.\n\nThus compile list across all records.\n\nLet's ensure no other biomarkers: \"Flortaucipir\" is a radiotracer but not listed as biomarker. Not needed.\n\nCheck \"Plasma Amyloid (A) Beta(1-x)\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Amyloid (A) Beta(1-x) and Abeta(1-42)\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"Left and Right Hippocampal Volume\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"Whole Brain Volume\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"Total Hippocampal Volume\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"Total Ventricular Volume\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"QTcF interval\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"TEAE\" not biomarker.\n\nAlso \"Serious Adverse Events\" not biomarker.\n\nAlso \"Vital Signs\" not biomarker.\n\nAlso \"MRI\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"FAQ\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"MMSE\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"Urinary Total Integrated Radioactivity\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"NTB Z-score\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"ADCS-ADL\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"CDR-SB\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"ADAS-cog11\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"Plasma Aβ\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"CSF Aβ\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"Hippocampal Volume\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"Whole Brain Volume\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"Venticular Volume\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"QTcF\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"MRI\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"FAQ\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"MMSE\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"Urinary Total Integrated Radioactivity\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"NTB Z-score\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"ADCS-ADL\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"CDR-SB\" – yes.\n\nAlso \"ADAS-cog11\" – yes.\n\nOk.\n\nNow produce analysis sentence referencing evidence. Must be 4-5 sentences. We'll mention that the record contains multiple imaging, fluid, and clinical assessment biomarkers. Provide concise.\n\nThen biomarkers array sorted alphabetically? Not required. Just list.\n\nNeed to ensure each element follows syntax: \"ACRONYM: expanded form of the acronym (or brief description if no acronym exists)\". For non-acronym like \"Plasma Aβ\" we can treat acronym as \"Plasma Aβ\" but that's not uppercase. Maybe use \"PLASMA Aβ\" but not typical. We can use \"Plasma Aβ: Plasma amyloid beta\". But rule: always use acronym in uppercase when available. For \"Plasma Aβ\" no acronym. So we can use \"Plasma Aβ: Plasma amyloid beta\". That's okay.\n\nFor \"CSF Aβ\" we can use \"CSF Aβ: Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta\".\n\nFor \"Hippocampal Volume\" no acronym. Use \"Hippocampal Volume: Left and right hippocampal volume\".\n\nFor \"Total Hippocampal Volume\" use \"Total Hippocampal Volume: Sum of left and right hippocampal volumes\".\n\nFor \"Ventricular Volume\" use \"Ventricular Volume: Total ventricular volume\".\n\nFor \"QTcF\" use \"QTcF: Corrected QT interval (Fridericia's formula)\".\n\nFor \"MRI\" use \"MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging\".\n\nFor \"FAQ\" use \"FAQ: Functional Assessment Questionnaire\".\n\nFor \"MMSE\" use \"MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination\".\n\nFor \"Urinary Total Integrated Radioactivity\" use \"Urinary Total Integrated Radioactivity: Total integrated radioactivity excreted in urine\".\n\nFor \"NTB Z-score\" use \"NTB Z-score: Neuropsychological Test Battery total z‑score\".\n\nFor \"ADCS-ADL\" use \"ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living\".\n\nFor \"CDR-SB\" use \"CDR-SB: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes\".\n\nFor \"ADAS-cog11\" use \"ADAS-cog11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale‑Cognitive Subscale\".\n\nAlso \"Plasma Aβ\" maybe \"Plasma Aβ: Plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) measurements\".\n\nAlso \"CSF Aβ\" similar.\n\nAlso \"Left Hippocampal Volume\" maybe \"LH VOLUME: Left hippocampal volume\". But we didn't decide. We can keep \"Hippocampal Volume\" generic. But we also have \"Left and Right Hippocampal Volume\" as percent change. So maybe we should list \"Left Hippocampal Volume\" and \"Right Hippocampal Volume\" separately. But easier: \"Hippocampal Volume: Left and right hippocampal volume\". That covers both.\n\nBut then \"Total Hippocampal Volume\" separate.\n\nOk.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nEnsure no extra spaces or lines outside JSON.\n\nLet's craft analysis: 4-5 sentences.\n\nPossible analysis: \"The first record enumerates several imaging and fluid biomarkers such as MRI, plasma and CSF amyloid β, hippocampal and whole‑brain volumes, and ventricular volume, along with the cardiac QTcF interval.

Let's parse each record.\n\nRecord 1:\n\nBrief summary: imaging results detected on a 18F-AV-1451 PET scan and pathology at autopsy. Outcome measurement title lists various regions: Relationship of Flortaucipir Scan and Pathology -... So biomarker: Flortaucipir scan? Actually Flortaucipir is 18F-AV-1451. Also SUVr (standard uptake value ratio). Also AT8 antibody immunohistology. Biomarkers: Flortaucipir PET scan (18F-AV-1451), SUVr, AT8 immunohistology. Are we supposed to list biomarkers like \"Flortaucipir PET scan\"? The example uses \"flortaucipir standard uptake value ratio (SUVr)\" as biomarker. They also mention \"AT8 antibody\". That is a biomarker of tau pathology. So we should list:\n\n- Flortaucipir PET: 18F-AV-1451 PET scan\n- SUVr: Standard Uptake Value Ratio (PET)\n- AT8: Immunohistology using AT8 antibody (tau phosphorylation)\n\nBut check rule: Use acronym uppercase before colon. For Flortaucipir PET, acronym could be FOT? But it's not an acronym; maybe \"Flortaucipir PET\" is fine. But we need acronym uppercase. Could use \"FLORTAUCIIPIR PET\" but that's too long. Maybe \"FTCPET\"? Not in text. The instruction says: \"If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form.\" So we can create \"Flortaucipir PET\" as abbreviation? But we need uppercase. Could use \"FLTTPET\"? Might be confusing. Perhaps just use \"Flortaucipir PET: 18F-AV-1451 PET scan\". But acronym must be uppercase. We could use \"FLT: Flortaucipir PET scan\". But FLT is also known for other things. However, we can choose \"FLT: Flortaucipir PET scan\". But the text doesn't give FLT. Another approach: Use \"Flortaucipir PET: 18F-AV-1451 PET scan\". The requirement: \"Each element in the array MUST follow this exact syntax: 'ACRONYM: expanded form of the acronym (or brief description if no acronym exists)'\". So we need an acronym. If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form. So we can create \"FPT: Flortaucipir PET scan\". Or \"FTR: Flortaucipir PET scan\". Let's pick \"FTR: Flortaucipir PET scan\". But might conflict with other. It's okay.\n\nAlso \"SUVr\" is already an acronym. So \"SUVr: Standard Uptake Value Ratio\".\n\n\"AT8\" is an acronym. So \"AT8: Immunohistology using AT8 antibody\".\n\nNow Record 2:\n\nBiomarkers: Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) – acronym COWAT. Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). FDG-PET SUVR – SUVR. Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD). ADAS-Cog 11 – ADAS-Cog/11. Digit Span – DS? But maybe \"Digit Span\" no acronym. We can use \"DS: Digit Span\". MMSE – MMSE. ADCS-ADL – ADCS-ADL.\n\nAlso \"FDG-PET\" itself is a biomarker. But we already have SUVR. Should we list FDG-PET? The outcome measurement title includes \"Change in Regional Glucose Metabolism... as Measured by 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET).\" So FDG-PET is a biomarker. So we list \"FDG-PET: 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography\".\n\nAlso \"COWAT\" is a test. So \"COWAT: Controlled Oral Word Association Test\".\n\n\"NPI\" is \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory\".\n\n\"SUVR\" is \"Standard Uptake Value Ratio\".\n\n\"QoL-AD\" is \"Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease\".\n\n\"ADAS-Cog/11\" is \"Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\".\n\n\"Digit Span\" – we can call \"DS: Digit Span\".\n\n\"MMSE\" – \"Mini Mental Status Examination\".\n\n\"ADCS-ADL\" – \"Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living\".\n\nAlso \"FDG-PET\" we already listed.\n\nAlso \"Regional Glucose Metabolism\" is part of FDG-PET measurement. But we don't need separate.\n\nThus compile unique biomarkers across both records.\n\nList:\n\nFrom record 1:\n- FTR: Flortaucipir PET scan (18F-AV-1451 PET scan)\n- SUVr: Standard Uptake Value Ratio\n- AT8: Immunohistology using AT8 antibody\n\nFrom record 2:\n- COWAT: Controlled Oral Word Association Test\n- NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\n- FDG-PET: 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography\n- SUVR: Standard Uptake Value Ratio (already duplicate, keep once)\n- QoL-AD: Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease\n- ADAS-Cog/11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\n- DS: Digit Span\n- MMSE: Mini Mental Status Examination\n- ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living\n\nCheck duplicates: SUVR appears twice; keep once.\n\nAlso \"Flortaucipir PET scan\" vs \"FDG-PET\" are distinct.\n\nNow ensure each entry has uppercase acronym before colon.

Must collapse duplicates.\n\nFrom first record:\n\n- Maximal CSF VX-745 Concentration: that's a measurement of drug concentration in CSF. So biomarker: VX-745: drug concentration? But we need acronym: VX-745 is the compound itself. Could treat as \"VX-745: concentration of VX-745 in cerebrospinal fluid\". Also mention plasma concentration? The title says \"plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of VX-745\". So biomarker: VX-745: plasma concentration? Might just list \"VX-745: concentration in plasma\" and \"VX-745: concentration in CSF\". But maybe combine as same biomarker? The instruction: each element must follow syntax \"ACRONYM: expanded form\". For drug concentration, acronym could be \"VX-745: concentration of VX-745\". But we might need separate entries for CSF and plasma? The record mentions \"plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of VX-745\". So two biomarkers: \"Plasma VX-745: concentration of VX-745 in plasma\" and \"CSF VX-745: concentration of VX-745 in cerebrospinal fluid\". However the acronym \"Plasma VX-745\" isn't standard. Maybe use \"PLX-VX-745\"? Not good. Perhaps use \"CSF VX-745\" as acronym. But guidelines say always use uppercase acronym before colon. We can use \"CSF-VX-745\" but that's weird. Let's think: The biomarker is \"VX-745 concentration in CSF\". Acronym could be \"CSF-VX-745\". Similarly \"PLT-VX-745\" for plasma. But maybe simpler: \"VX-745: concentration in CSF\" and \"VX-745: concentration in plasma\". That would duplicate acronym but with different description. Is duplication allowed? They said collapse duplicates; each biomarker appears once. So can't have two entries with same acronym. So maybe we list \"VX-745: concentration in plasma and CSF\" combined. But then we lose specificity. But it's okay because biomarker is drug concentration.

Since none, we can create abbreviation like \"BV: Brain Volume\". Acceptable? The instruction: \"If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form.\" So we can use \"BV: Brain Volume\". Good.\n\n- Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB). Acronym CDR-SOB. So \"CDR-SOB: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes\".\n\n- Everyday Cognition Scale (ECog-Informant) Total Scores. Acronym ECog. So \"ECog: Everyday Cognition Scale\".\n\n- MRI abnormalities: ARIA-E, ARIA-H, White Matter Disease. These are imaging markers. Acronyms exist: ARIA-E, ARIA-H. So include \"ARIA-E: Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormality-Edema\", \"ARIA-H: Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormality-Hemorrhage\".\n\n- CAD106 induced antibody titers: \"Abeta-specific Antibody Titers\". Acronym maybe \"Abeta\". But we can use \"Abeta: Amyloid beta\". But it's antibody titer. Maybe \"Abeta-Ab: Anti-Amyloid beta antibody\". But simpler: \"Abeta: Amyloid beta\". But we want \"CAD106 Induced Abeta-specific Antibody Titers\". So acronym \"Abeta\". We'll list \"Abeta: Amyloid beta\".\n\n- APCC: Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Composite Cognitive Test Score. Acronym APCC. So \"APCC: Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Composite Cognitive\".\n\n- Amyloid deposition measured by Centiloids of PET scan. Acronym \"Centiloid\". But we can use \"Centiloid: Centiloid measurement of amyloid PET\". Or \"PET Centiloid\". Let's use \"Centiloid: Centiloid measurement of amyloid PET\".\n\n- Cmax of CAD106 induced antibody titers. Acronym Cmax. So \"Cmax: Maximum concentration of CAD106-induced antibody titers\".\n\nAlso \"Serum Neurofilaments\" already covered.\n\nAlso \"Cohort I: Area Under the Concentration Curve (AUC) of CAD106 Induced Abeta-specific Antibody Titers\". Acronym AUC. So \"AUC: Area Under the Concentration Curve\".\n\nAlso \"Peak Concentration (Cmax) of CAD106 Induced Abeta-specific Antibody Titers\" duplicate.\n\nAlso \"Cohort I: Annualized Change in Amyloid Deposition as Measured by Centiloids of PET Scan With Amyloid Radiotracer\" duplicate.\n\nAlso \"Cohort I: Area Under the Concentration Curve (AUC) of CAD106 Induced Abeta-specific Antibody Titers\" duplicate.\n\nAlso \"Cohort I: Peak Concentration (Cmax) of CAD106 Induced Abeta-specific Antibody Titers\" duplicate.\n\nAlso \"Cohort I: Area Under the Concentration Curve (AUC) of CAD106 Induced Abeta-specific Antibody Titers\" duplicate.\n\nAlso \"Cohort I: Peak Concentration (Cmax) of CAD106 Induced Abeta-specific Antibody Titers\" duplicate.\n\nAlso \"Cohort I: Annualized Change in Amyloid Deposition as Measured by Centiloids of PET Scan With Amyloid Radiotracer\" duplicate.\n\nAlso \"Cohort I: Area Under the Concentration Curve (AUC) of CAD106 Induced Abeta-specific Antibody Titers\" duplicate.\n\nOk.\n\nNow second record:\n\nBiomarkers:\n\n- Plasma PK parameters: Cmax, Racc, CLss/F, Tlag, Tmax, T1/2, AUCtau. These are pharmacokinetic biomarkers. Acronyms: Cmax, Racc, CLss/F, Tlag, Tmax, T1/2, AUCtau. Provide expansions.\n\n- Amyloid Beta (Aβ) 1-38, 1-40, 1-42 concentrations in CSF. Acronym Aβ. So \"Aβ: Amyloid beta\".\n\n- CSF PK concentrations. So \"CSF: Cerebrospinal Fluid\".\n\nThus list unique biomarkers across both records.\n\nLet's compile list:\n\n- NfL: Light chain neurofilament\n- RBANS: Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status\n- BV: Brain Volume (MRI)\n- CDR-SOB: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes\n- ECog: Everyday Cognition Scale\n- ARIA-E: Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormality-Edema\n- ARIA-H: Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormality-Hemorrhage\n- Abeta: Amyloid beta\n- APCC: Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Composite Cognitive\n- Centiloid: Centiloid measurement of amyloid PET\n- Cmax: Maximum concentration of CAD106-induced antibody titers\n- AUC: Area Under the Concentration Curve\n- Cmax (duplicate) but same acronym; keep once.\n- CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating (maybe separate from CDR-SOB). Mentioned in description. So add \"CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating\".\n- MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination (mentioned in APCC description). Add \"MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination\".\n- Raven's Progressive Matrices (not acronym). Could include \"RPM: Raven's Progressive Matrices\". But not necessary? It's part of APCC. But it's a biomarker? It's a cognitive test. Might include. But we can include \"RPM: Raven's Progressive Matrices\".\n\n- C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. It's a measurement but not biomarker? It's a scale. Could include.\n\nBut focus on biomarkers explicitly present. Many scales are considered biomarkers. So include all.\n\nList from second record:\n\n- Cmax: Maximum plasma concentration\n- Racc: Accumulation ratio\n- CLss/F: Apparent systemic clearance at steady state\n- Tlag: Time lag\n- Tmax: Time to maximum concentration\n- T1/2: Terminal elimination half-life\n- AUCtau: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve over dosing interval\n- Aβ: Amyloid beta\n- CSF: Cerebrospinal Fluid\n- C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (though not in second record?

Outcome measurement titles: ADAS-Cog 11, CDR-SB, ADCS-ADL, MMSE, NPI. So biomarkers: ADAS-Cog 11, CDR-SB, ADCS-ADL, MMSE, NPI. Also mention ADAScog-11 earlier. But same as ADAS-Cog 11. Also mention 5-HT6? That's a receptor, not biomarker. So list: ADAS-Cog 11, CDR-SB, ADCS-ADL, MMSE, NPI. Also maybe ADAScog-11 spelled differently. Use consistent acronym: ADAS-Cog 11. Provide expanded forms: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 11, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living, Mini-Mental State Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory.\n\nAlso mention ADAScog-11 earlier but same.

So biomarkers: ADAS-Cog-13, ADCS-ADL, DS (Dependence Scale), CIBIC+, RVT-101 concentration in plasma, NPI, ADAS-Cog-11. Also mention ADAS-Cog-13 earlier. Also mention ADAS-Cog-11 earlier.

DLT events count could be considered. But likely focus on plasma levels. Also mention \"Plasma Levels of OOA\". So biomarker: OAA plasma concentration.

But biomarkers explicitly present? We should include those mentioned in outcome titles/descriptions. Also mention CT/MRI imaging? Not a biomarker per se; imaging used but not specified as biomarker. But maybe \"Computed Tomography (CT)\" or MRI scan is a biomarker? Usually imaging is a biomarker. But we only include explicitly present. The record mentions \"brain imaging with findings consistent with the diagnosis of dementia due to AD\". That could be considered biomarker. But it's generic. Might still count. But safer to include only those clearly named.\n\nList:\n\nCGIC: Global Impression of Change (though acronym CGIC stands for Clinical Global Impression? Actually CGIC stands for Clinical Global Impression of Change). Use \"CGIC: Clinical Global Impression of Change\".\n\nADCS-MCI-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living Scale Adapted for MCI.\n\nPSQI: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.\n\nBlood Chemistry: maybe just \"Blood Chemistry\" but that's a category.

Might include \"CT: Computed Tomography\" and \"MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging\". But are they biomarkers? They are imaging techniques. Could be considered biomarkers. But the instruction says biomarker is quantifiable characteristic. Imaging results would be biomarker. But the record doesn't specify particular imaging metric like hippocampal volume. Just says \"brain imaging with findings consistent with diagnosis\". Might be too vague.

Also \"Organ Effective Dose\" etc. Also \"Effective Dose\" (ED). Also \"BPND\" itself. Also \"SUV\" and \"AUC\" but those are derived metrics. But we can include BPND. Also \"Mean Organ Effective Dose\" is a biomarker. \"Mean Effective Dose\" is a biomarker. \"Test-Retest Variability\" is a metric. \"Non-displaceable Binding Potential\" is a biomarker. Also \"Organ Effective Dose\" maybe same as \"Effective Dose\".

We should not include non-biomarkers like \"walking program\". Also note that some instruments are clinical assessment tools, considered biomarkers. So we need to identify all biomarkers across all records.\n\nLet's go record by record.\n\nRecord 1:\n\nBrief summary: walking program, brain energy metabolism. Outcome measurement title: \"Brain Glucose Consumption; Brain Acetoacetate Consumption;\" Description: \"Brain glucose uptake (umol/100g/min) using 18F-FDG PET imaging; Brain acetoacetate uptake (umol/100g/min) using 11C-AcAc PET imaging;\"\n\nBiomarkers: 18F-FDG PET imaging (brain glucose uptake). 11C-AcAc PET imaging (acetoacetate uptake). Are these considered biomarkers? Yes, they are imaging biomarkers. Should we list them as \"18F-FDG PET: fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for brain glucose uptake\" and \"11C-AcAc PET: carbon-11 labeled acetoacetate PET for brain acetoacetate uptake\".\n\nAlso maybe \"Brain Glucose Consumption\" and \"Brain Acetoacetate Consumption\" but that's just the measurement. But we need to list biomarkers with acronym. There's no acronym but we can use \"FDG-PET\" etc. Use \"18F-FDG PET: fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for brain glucose uptake\" and \"11C-AcAc PET: carbon-11 labeled acetoacetate PET for brain acetoacetate uptake\".\n\nBut check rule: \"If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form.\" So we can use \"FDG-PET\" and \"AcAc-PET\". But we might keep the isotope notation. Let's choose \"18F-FDG PET: fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for brain glucose uptake\" and \"11C-AcAc PET: carbon-11 labeled acetoacetate positron emission tomography for brain acetoacetate uptake\".\n\nOk.\n\nRecord 2:\n\nBrief summary: EPA, IPE, brain blood flow, CSF markers of AD pathology, cognitive performance. Detailed description: mentions MRI, CSF, cognitive biomarkers. Outcome measurement title: \"Cognitive Performance; Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease; Regional Cerebral Blood Flow Using Arterial Spin-labeling MRI;\" Description: lists ADCS-PACC, CSF beta-amyloid-42, total tau, phosphorylated tau-181 (Roche Cobas Elecsys e611). Also mentions posterior cingulate gyrus blood flow.\n\nSo biomarkers: ADCS-PACC (preclinical Alzheimer's cognitive composite). CSF beta-amyloid-42. CSF total tau. CSF phosphorylated tau-181. Regional cerebral blood flow via ASL MRI (but that's an imaging biomarker). Maybe \"ASL-MRI: arterial spin labeling MRI for regional cerebral blood flow\". Also \"Posterior cingulate gyrus blood flow\" but that's part of ASL-MRI.\n\nThus list: ADCS-PACC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite; CSF β‑amyloid‑42: cerebrospinal fluid beta‑amyloid 42; CSF total tau: cerebrospinal fluid total tau; CSF phospho-tau‑181: cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau 181; ASL-MRI: arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging for regional cerebral blood flow.\n\nAlso maybe \"MRI\" but it's generic. But we can include \"ASL-MRI\" as above.\n\nRecord 3:\n\nBrief summary: palliative care. No biomarkers. Outcome measurement titles: various counts of visits, domains, caregiver strain, CAD-EOLD, POLST, hospice referrals, burdensome treatments. None are biomarkers. So no biomarkers.\n\nRecord 4:\n\nXanADu Phase II study. Outcome measurement titles: CDR-SOB; AD COMposite Scores; RAVLT; MMSE; ADAS-Cog v14; NTB - Executive Domain; NPI (Neuropsychiatric Inventory).\n\nThese are clinical assessment tools. So biomarkers: CDR-SOB: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes; ADCOMs: AD Composite Scores (maybe \"ADCOMs: Alzheimer's Disease Composite Scores\"); RAVLT: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test; MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination; ADAS-Cog v14: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale version 14; NTB: Neuropsychological Test Battery – Executive Domain; NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory.\n\nAlso maybe \"ADAS-Cog v14\" already listed. Good.\n\nNow compile list across all records, deduplicate.\n\nList:\n\n- 18F-FDG PET: fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for brain glucose uptake\n- 11C-AcAc PET: carbon-11 labeled acetoacetate positron emission tomography for brain acetoacetate uptake\n- ADCS-PACC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite\n- CSF β‑amyloid‑42: cerebrospinal fluid beta‑amyloid 42\n- CSF total tau: cerebrospinal fluid total tau\n- CSF phospho-tau‑181: cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau 181\n- ASL-MRI: arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging for regional cerebral blood flow\n- CDR-SOB: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes\n- ADCOMS: Alzheimer's Disease Composite Scores\n- RAVLT: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test\n- MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination\n- ADAS-Cog v14: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale version 14\n- NTB: Neuropsychological Test Battery – Executive Domain\n- NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\n\nCheck duplicates: CDR-SOB appears twice but same. ADCOMS appears once.

Provide concise analysis.\n\nLet's write 4 sentences.\n\nSentence 1: Record 1 reports brain glucose and acetoacetate uptake quantified by 18F‑FDG and 11C‑AcAc PET, respectively, making these imaging biomarkers explicit. Sentence 2: Record 2 details CSF measurements of β‑amyloid‑42, total tau, and phospho‑tau‑181, along with arterial spin‑labeling MRI of regional cerebral blood flow, and uses the ADCS‑PACC composite as a cognitive biomarker. Sentence 3: Record 4 lists several validated neuropsychological instruments—CDR‑SOB, ADCOMS, RAVLT, MMSE, ADAS‑Cog v14, NTB executive domain, and NPI—that serve as quantitative clinical biomarkers. Sentence 4: No other records contain explicit biomarker definitions, so the compiled list reflects all unique biomarkers identified across the dataset.\n\nMake sure 4-5 sentences. That's 4 sentences.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nEnsure array elements formatted correctly: \"ACRONYM: expanded form\". For CSF β‑amyloid‑42, we need acronym \"CSF β‑amyloid‑42\"? But we need acronym uppercase. Could use \"CSF β‑Aβ42\" but maybe \"CSF β‑amyloid‑42\". But rule: always use acronym uppercase before colon. If no acronym, create logical abbreviation. For CSF β‑amyloid‑42, acronym could be \"CSF β‑Aβ42\" but that's messy. Perhaps use \"CSF β‑amyloid‑42: cerebrospinal fluid beta‑amyloid 42\". That uses \"CSF β‑amyloid‑42\" as acronym. It's okay though contains special characters. Might be acceptable. Similarly \"CSF total tau\" acronym \"CSF tTau\". But we can use \"CSF tTau\". But simpler: \"CSF tTau: cerebrospinal fluid total tau\". And \"CSF pTau‑181: cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau 181\". That seems fine.\n\nSimilarly \"ASL-MRI\" is acronym. \"ADCOMs\" is acronym. \"NTB\" is acronym. \"ADAS-Cog v14\" is acronym. \"RAVLT\" is acronym. \"MMSE\" is acronym. \"NPI\" is acronym. \"CDR-SOB\" is acronym. \"18F-FDG PET\" is acronym. \"11C-AcAc PET\" is acronym.\n\nLet's list accordingly.\n\nArray entries:\n\n\"18F-FDG PET: fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for brain glucose uptake\"\n\"11C-AcAc PET: carbon-11 labeled acetoacetate positron emission tomography for brain acetoacetate uptake\"\n\"ADCS-PACC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite\"\n\"CSF β‑amyloid‑42: cerebrospinal fluid beta‑amyloid 42\"\n\"CSF tTau: cerebrospinal fluid total tau\"\n\"CSF pTau‑181: cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau 181\"\n\"ASL-MRI: arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging for regional cerebral blood flow\"\n\"CDR-SOB: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes\"\n\"ADCOMs: Alzheimer's Disease Composite Scores\"\n\"RAVLT: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test\"\n\"MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination\"\n\"ADAS-Cog v14: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale version 14\"\n\"NTB: Neuropsychological Test Battery – Executive Domain\"\n\"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\"\n\nCheck duplicates: none.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Might be included? The example didn't include PK parameters. In earlier examples, they didn't include PK. So likely exclude PK. Also \"Population PK: Apparent Oral Clearance of Lanabecestat\" is not a disease biomarker. So skip.\n\nSimilarly, \"Time to Progression as Measured by Loss of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Global Score Stage\" is more endpoint than biomarker. But CDR-SB is a biomarker. We'll include CDR-SOB.\n\nThus list:\n\n- rCBF: Regional Cerebral Blood Flow (from Florbetapir perfusion scan)\n- WBV: Whole Brain Volume (MRI)\n- CSF-Tau: CSF Biomarker Total Tau\n- FAQ: Functional Activities Questionnaire\n- Florbetapir-Amyloid PET: Brain Amyloid Burden (using Florbetapir PET)\n- CSF-Aβ40: Concentration of CSF Biomarker Aβ-40\n- ADCS-iADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory Instrumental Items Score\n- MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination\n- CDR-SB: Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes\n- CDR-GS: Clinical Dementia Rating Global Score Stage? Maybe just CDR-GS but not sure. Could treat as CDR-GS but it's not a biomarker but a stage. Might skip.\n- iADRS: Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale\n- NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\n- CSF-pTau: CSF Biomarker Phosphorylated Tau\n- ADAS-Cog13: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\n- CSF-Aβ42: Concentration of CSF Biomarker Amyloid Beta (Aβ)1-42\n- Plasma-Aβ1-40: Concentration of peptide Aβ1-40 in plasma\n- Plasma-Aβ1-42: Concentration of peptide Aβ1-42 in plasma\n\nAlso mention \"Centiloid scale\" but that's a metric derived from PET. Not separate biomarker.\n\nAlso \"Fluorbetapir perfusion scan\" already captured as rCBF.\n\nNow ensure acronyms: Use uppercase acronyms. For some like \"Whole Brain Volume\" no acronym; we can use WBV. For \"Brain Amyloid Burden Using Florbetapir Amyloid PET\" we can use FBP PET? Actually Florbetapir is FBB? Usually Florbetapir is ^18F-florbetapir, also called AV45. But we can use \"FBP-PET\". But simpler: \"FBP-PET: Florbetapir Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography\".\n\nFor \"Regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF)\" use rCBF.\n\nFor \"CSF Biomarker Total Tau\" use CSF-Tau.\n\nFor \"CSF Biomarker Aβ-40\" use CSF-Aβ40.\n\nFor \"CSF Biomarker Phosphorylated Tau\" use CSF-pTau.\n\nFor \"CSF Biomarker Amyloid Beta (Aβ)1-42\" use CSF-Aβ42.\n\nFor \"Plasma Aβ1-40\" use Plasma-Aβ40.\n\nFor \"Plasma Aβ1-42\" use Plasma-Aβ42.\n\nFor \"Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ)\" use FAQ.\n\nFor \"ADCS-iADL\" use ADCS-iADL.\n\nFor \"Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)\" use MMSE.\n\nFor \"Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB)\" use CDR-SB.\n\nFor \"Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS)\" use iADRS.\n\nFor \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)\" use NPI.\n\nFor \"Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13)\" use ADAS-Cog13.\n\nFor \"Whole Brain Volume\" use WBV.\n\nFor \"Regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF) Using Florbetapir Perfusion Scan\" we already have rCBF.\n\nFor \"Brain Amyloid Burden Using Florbetapir Amyloid PET\" we have FBP-PET.\n\nAlso \"Florbetapir perfusion\" is rCBF; \"Florbetapir amyloid PET\" is FBP-PET.\n\nAlso \"Centiloid scale\" maybe not needed.\n\nNow produce analysis sentence referencing evidence.\n\nNeed 4-5 concise sentences.

For ADCS-ADL: \"ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living\". For APOE: \"APOE: Apolipoprotein E genotype\". For MMSE: \"MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination\".\n\nAlso maybe \"Blood\" but not a biomarker.

But CIBIS is a severity score derived from CIBIC+. It's still a biomarker. Use \"CIBIC+\": \"Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change\". \"CIBIS\": \"Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Severity\". ADAS-Cog11: \"ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 11-item\". ADCS-ADL: \"ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living\".

ADCS-iADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Inventory. PK: Pharmacokinetics (but we might just list AUC [T,SS] as biomarker). Maybe \"LY3202626 AUC[T,SS]\" but we can call \"AUC[T,SS]: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve at Steady State\". Plasma Amyloid Beta Aβ1‑40: \"Aβ1‑40: Plasma Amyloid Beta 1‑40\". Similarly Aβ1‑42. \"1‑x Concentration\" unclear; maybe \"Aβ1‑x: Plasma Amyloid Beta 1‑x\". ADAS-Cog13: \"ADAS-Cog13: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13-item\". 18F-AV-1451 PET SUVr: \"18F-AV-1451 PET SUVr: Standard Uptake Value Ratio of 18F-AV-1451 PET\".

Also mentions Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) earlier? But outcome uses NPI-C. So biomarkers: PAS, NPI-C. Also maybe \"Adverse Events\" but that's not a biomarker. So list: PAS: Pittsburgh Agitation Scale, NPI-C: Neuropsychiatric Inventory Clinician Version.\n\nAlso mention \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)\" earlier but not in outcome.

But the example didn't include NPI when not in outcome? Example 2 had NPI in outcome. Example 1 had 3MSE etc. They extracted only those in outcome. But rule: \"extract ONLY biomarkers explicitly present in the text\". That includes entire record. So NPI is present. However, is NPI a biomarker? It's a clinical assessment tool. Yes. So should include NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory. But the outcome uses NPI-C version. Might include both. But duplication collapse. We can include NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory.

Maybe we list \"CSF Biomarkers: Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers\". But better to list specific ones.

Outcome measurement title: \"18F-THK-5351 Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\". Description: SUV ratio of PET scan. So biomarkers: 18F-THK-5351 PET SUVR; maybe CSF biomarkers? But not specified what CSF biomarkers measured. Only mention \"measure CSF concentrations of biomarkers\" generically. Not specific. So we list 18F-THK-5351 SUVR. Also maybe \"Tau PET\" but acronym? We should use \"18F-THK-5351: tracer used in PET scan to quantify tau pathology\". Also \"SUVR: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\" could be considered biomarker? It's a derived metric. Yes it's a biomarker. So include \"SUVR: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\".\n\nAlso mention \"CSF concentrations of biomarkers\" but unspecified. No specific biomarker names. So skip.\n\nRecord 2:\n\nDetailed description lists many biomarkers: Posiphen PK, metabolites in plasma and CSF. Measures CSF and plasma levels of biomarkers, inflammatory factors, control proteins. Also \"fractional synthesis rate of Aβ40 in CSF using SILK technique\". Also \"levels of Aβ38, Aβ40, Aβ42, sAPPα, sAPPβ, and T-Tau sampled at screening and start of confinement visit\". Also ADAS-Cog12, NPI, MMSE. Those are clinical assessment tools, considered biomarkers.

Not needed.\n\nBiomarkers:\n\n- Aβ38\n- Aβ40\n- Aβ42\n- sAPPα\n- sAPPβ\n- T-Tau\n- CSF Posiphen concentrations?

NPI is a questionnaire, not a bodily measurement. So exclude.\n\nAlso earlier in detailed description: mentions fluid biomarkers: amyloid burden, tangle pathology, axonal injury, microglia activation/inflammation, neurotrophic factors. Specific markers listed: MCP-1, MCP-3, MIP-1β, UCH-L1, NfL, VEGF, BDNF. Those are biomarkers.\n\nAlso mention of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, p-tau. But those are general pathologic hallmarks, not necessarily measured. But they are biomarkers too. But we should list them if explicitly referenced as biomarkers. The record states: \"fluid biomarkers of AD pathology including amyloid burden, tangle pathology, axonal injury, microglia activation/inflammation, and neurotrophic factors\". Then lists specific proteins: MCP-1, MCP-3, MIP-1β, UCH-L1, NfL, VEGF, BDNF. Also mentions \"beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide\" and \"hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau)\" as hallmarks.

The record also later refers to \"CSF Levels of Tau\" etc. So we should include tau, Aβ42, NfL, UCH-L1, MCP-1, MCP-3, MIP-1β, VEGF, BDNF.\n\nAlso mention of \"microglia activation/inflammation\" but no specific marker. So skip.\n\nAlso mention of \"axonal injury\" but NfL is the marker.\n\nAlso mention of \"neurotrophic factors\" like VEGF, BDNF.\n\nAlso mention of \"p-tau\" maybe separate from tau.

In detailed description: \"senile plaques rich in β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau).\" Later outcome measurement includes \"Plasma Levels of Tau.\" No mention of p-tau in outcomes. So we might not list p-tau unless explicitly measured. But it's part of pathology. Might still count as biomarker. But safer to include only those explicitly measured or listed as biomarkers.

MIP-1β: \"MIP-1β: macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta\". VEGF: \"VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor\". BDNF: \"BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor\".\n\nAlso \"Tau\" itself: \"Tau: tau protein\". But we might duplicate with CSF Tau and Plasma Tau. But we need unique entries. We can keep \"Tau: tau protein\" as generic biomarker. But maybe redundant. The instruction: collapse duplicates. So if we list \"Tau\" and \"CSF Tau\" and \"Plasma Tau\", that's fine because they are different contexts. But \"Tau\" alone might be ambiguous.

Actually \"Mini-Mental Status Examination\" but usually MMSE)\n- ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\n- APOE e4 genotype (carrier status). That's a genetic biomarker. So \"APOE e4: Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele\"\n\nAlso \"MRI Hippocampal Volume\" appears twice but duplicate collapse.\n\nAlso \"MRI Hippocampal Volume in Mild Subgroup\" same.\n\nAlso \"MRI Hippocampal Volume Change\" etc. But still same biomarker.\n\nAlso \"MRI Hippocampal Volume Change\" maybe separate?

Biomarkers definition: quantifiable characteristic of body serving as objective indicator of biological processes or pathological conditions in AD. We should consider clinical scales, imaging, lab values, etc. Must not invent.\n\nRecord 1: aducanumab study. Outcome measurement titles mention ARIA severity, adverse events, MRI. Biomarkers: ARIA? It's a condition, but ARIA severity measured by MRI. So MRI is imaging modality. Also PK, immunogenicity, but not listed in outcomes. Only biomarkers explicitly present: ARIA severity (but that's a clinical endpoint). MRI is imaging biomarker. Also maybe ARIA itself? But ARIA is a phenomenon, not a biomarker. However ARIA severity measured by MRI qualifies as biomarker. Also \"Adverse Events\" not biomarker. So list: MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Maybe also \"ARIA\" as a biomarker? Might treat ARIA as a biomarker of safety. But requirement: biomarker is quantifiable characteristic. ARIA severity is quantified. So we can list \"ARIA: Amyloid-related Imaging Abnormalities\". Provide expansion. Use acronym ARIA. Good.\n\nAlso \"PK\" not in outcomes. Not needed.\n\nSo biomarkers: ARIA: Amyloid-related Imaging Abnormalities, MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging.\n\nRecord 2: SGM older adults. Outcome measurements: Change in Physical Activity; Change in Physical Functioning; Change in Quality of Life. Descriptions give metrics: minutes exercised per week; Physical Functioning subscale of SF-36; QOL-AD. So biomarkers: Minutes of exercise per week (not acronym). But we need acronym. Could use \"PA: Physical Activity\" but not given. We can use \"SF-36: Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form\". Also \"QOL-AD: Quality of Life Alzheimer's Disease-Measure\". Also \"Physical Functioning subscale of SF-36\" already captured. Also \"minutes spent exercising\" maybe \"Exercise Minutes\". But no acronym. We can create abbreviation \"EM: Exercise Minutes\"? But rule says if no acronym exists, create logical abbreviation or use shortest recognizable form. So we can use \"EM: Exercise Minutes\". But is that acceptable? Might be okay. But better to use \"PA: Physical Activity\" though not in text. The text uses \"Physical Activity\" phrase. Let's use \"PA: Physical Activity\". But it's not an acronym in text. The rule: always use acronym if available; if not, create logical abbreviation. So PA is fine.\n\nAlso \"SF-36: Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form\". And \"QOL-AD: Quality of Life Alzheimer's Disease-Measure\".\n\nAlso \"Physical Functioning subscale of SF-36\" is part of SF-36.\n\nThus biomarkers list: PA: Physical Activity, SF-36: Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form, QOL-AD: Quality of Life Alzheimer's Disease-Measure.\n\nRecord 3: PorchLight Project.

Not acronym. Could call \"IQ: Interaction Quality\" but not in text. Better to skip non-acronym. But we can still create abbreviation \"IQ: Interaction Quality\".

Caregiver Distress on NPI/NPI-NH. Also maybe \"Lorazepam mg\" is a biomarker? It's a dosage measure, but could be considered a biomarker? It's a pharmacologic measure.

These are PK parameters, considered biomarkers? They are quantifiable characteristics of drug disposition, yes. So we should list them. Also maybe mention \"ECG\" etc but not biomarker. Only those listed. So list each with acronym: Vz/F: Volume of Distribution (apparent), AUCextrap[%]: Percent Extrapolated Area Under the Curve to Infinity, λz: Elimination Rate Constant, AUCinf: Area Under the Curve to Infinity, T1/2: Terminal Elimination Half-Life, AUC: Area Under the Curve, Tlast: Time to Last Quantifiable Plasma Concentration, Tmax: Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration, Cl/F: Oral Clearance, Clast: Last Quantifiable Plasma Concentration, Cmax: Maximum Plasma Concentration.

Provide as \"λz: Elimination Rate Constant\". Good.\n\nRecord 2: Pilot RCT with dapagliflozin. Biomarkers: Cerebral NAA via MRS, Systemic NAA levels in blood and urine, Cerebral metabolism via FDG PET, Systemic metabolic biomarkers: lipids (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL), Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate, Insulin resistance markers: Hemoglobin A1c, glucose, insulin during tolerance testing, activated AKT and mTOR, platelet cytochrome oxidase, citrate synthase, inflammatory cytokines MCP-1, eotaxin, TNF alpha, CRP, body composition DEXA, resting metabolic rate. Also cognitive scales: ADAS-Cog14, Logical Memory I & II, Trail Making A/B, Stroop. But these are assessment tools, not biomarkers? They are clinical assessment tools, could be considered biomarkers. The instruction says biomarker is quantifiable characteristic of the body that serves as objective indicator of biological processes or pathological conditions. Clinical scales are not bodily characteristics. So probably exclude them. Focus on biochemical/metabolic biomarkers. So list: NAA (cerebral and systemic), FDG uptake (cerebral metabolism), Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Beta-hydroxybutyrate, Hemoglobin A1c, Glucose, Insulin, Activated AKT, mTOR, Platelet cytochrome oxidase, Citrate synthase, MCP-1, eotaxin, TNF alpha, CRP, DEXA fat mass, lean mass, Resting metabolic rate. Also maybe \"Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate\" acronym BHBA? But we can just use \"BHBA: Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate\". For insulin resistance markers: HOMA-IR? Not mentioned. Use \"HbA1c: Hemoglobin A1c\". For glucose, insulin, maybe \"Glucose: Serum Glucose\". For insulin, \"Insulin: Serum Insulin\".

For inflammatory markers: \"MCP-1: Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1\", \"Eotaxin: Eotaxin\", \"TNFα: Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha\", \"CRP: C-Reactive Protein\". For DEXA: \"Fat Mass: DEXA Fat Mass\", \"Lean Mass: DEXA Lean Mass\". For Resting Metabolic Rate: \"RMR: Resting Metabolic Rate\".\n\nAlso \"Cerebral NAA\" maybe acronym \"cNAA\". But we can use \"cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate\". And \"sNAA: Systemic N-acetyl Aspartate\". For FDG PET: \"FDG-PET: Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography\".

They mention wearing activity tracker, but not specific biomarker. They mention \"Fitness tracker dashboard\" but no quantified biomarker. They mention \"Lumosity Performance Index (LPI)\" which is a performance metric, not bodily. They mention \"RBANS scores\". Those are cognitive tests. Not biomarkers. So likely no biomarkers.

But we keep as given.\n\nRecord 2: Outcome measurement titles include:\n\n- CSF Tau Levels\n- NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB)\n- Number of Participants With Reported Anaphylaxis (not biomarker)\n- Number of Participants With Any GI Symptoms (not biomarker)\n- Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) Score\n- CSF Amyloid\n- Prothrombin Time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR)\n- Number of Discontinuations From Montelukast (not biomarker)\n- Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Score\n- Number of Participants With Elevated Liver Enzymes (not biomarker)\n- Number of Patients With Seizures (not biomarker)\n\nBiomarkers: CSF Tau Levels (specifically CSF-tau, p-tau181), CSF Amyloid (Aβ42), NIHTB-CB (fluid cognitive composite?), NPI-Q Score (neuropsychiatric inventory), PT/INR (coagulation), CDR Score (clinical). Also maybe \"CSF tau protein\" etc.\n\nSo list:\n\nCSF-tau: CSF Tau Levels (phospho tau p-tau181)\nCSF-Aβ42: CSF Amyloid\nNIHTB-CB: NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery\nNPI-Q: Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire\nPT/INR: Prothrombin Time / International Normalized Ratio\nCDR: Clinical Dementia Rating\n\nAlso \"CSF Tau Levels\" might be just CSF-tau; we already have.\n\nRecord 3: Outcome measurement titles include many PK parameters, but biomarkers? They are pharmacokinetic parameters of drug RO7126209. Are these considered biomarkers? They are drug concentration metrics, yes. Also \"Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Concentration of RO7126209\". So biomarkers: RO7126209 plasma concentration, CSF concentration, terminal half-life, clearance, etc. But these are drug PK biomarkers. According to definition, biomarker is quantifiable characteristic of body indicating biological processes. Drug concentration qualifies. So list:\n\nRO7126209 Plasma Concentration (maybe \"RO7126209 Plasma Concentration\")\nRO7126209 CSF Concentration\nRO7126209 Lambda z (terminal rate constant)\nRO7126209 Vss (volume of distribution at steady-state)\nRO7126209 Cend (concentration at end of infusion)\nRO7126209 AUC0-168h\nRO7126209 AUC0-last\nRO7126209 T1/2\nRO7126209 AUC0-24h\nRO7126209 CL (clearance)\nRO7126209 AUC0-inf\n\nBut we need to collapse duplicates. Use acronyms: For example \"Lambda z\" maybe \"Λz\"? But we can use \"Lambda z\" as acronym? Might use \"λz\". But requirement: always use uppercase acronym before colon. If no acronym, create logical abbreviation. For PK parameters, we could use \"RO7126209 Plasma Conc.\" but that's long. Maybe \"RO7126209 Plasma Concentration\". We'll use \"RO7126209 Plasma Conc.\" as acronym? But acronym should be uppercase letters. Could use \"RO7126209-PC\". But simpler: \"RO7126209 Plasma Concentration\". That has spaces. But rule says acronym uppercase before colon. We can use \"RO7126209-PC: Plasma Concentration\". Let's decide.\n\nBetter approach: Use \"RO7126209 Plasma Concentration\" as the whole phrase; but we need acronym. Could use \"RO7126209-PC\". Similarly \"RO7126209 CSF Concentration\" -> \"RO7126209-CSF\".\n\nFor other PK parameters: \"RO7126209 Lambda z\" -> \"RO7126209-LambdaZ\". \"RO7126209 Vss\" -> \"RO7126209-VSS\". \"RO7126209 Cend\" -> \"RO7126209-CEND\". \"RO7126209 AUC0-168h\" -> \"RO7126209-AUC0-168h\". \"RO7126209 AUC0-last\" -> \"RO7126209-AUC0-LAST\". \"RO7126209 T1/2\" -> \"RO7126209-T1/2\". \"RO7126209 AUC0-24h\" -> \"RO7126209-AUC0-24h\". \"RO7126209 CL\" -> \"RO7126209-CL\". \"RO7126209 AUC0-inf\" -> \"RO7126209-AUC0-INF\".\n\nBut maybe too many. However requirement: list all biomarkers explicitly present. So we should include all.\n\nNow compile list of unique biomarkers across all records:\n\nFrom Record1:\nCDR-sb\nADAS-cog14\nAmsterdam-IADL\nFAQ\nMMSE\n\nFrom Record2:\nCSF-tau\nCSF-Aβ42\nNIHTB-CB\nNPI-Q\nPT/INR\nCDR\n\nNote duplication: CDR appears in both. Keep one entry.\n\nFrom Record3:\nRO7126209-PC\nRO7126209-CSF\nRO7126209-LambdaZ\nRO7126209-VSS\nRO7126209-CEND\nRO7126209-AUC0-168h\nRO7126209-AUC0-LAST\nRO7126209-T1/2\nRO7126209-AUC0-24h\nRO7126209-CL\nRO7126209-AUC0-INF\n\nAlso maybe \"RO7126209\" itself? Not needed.\n\nNow craft analysis sentence referencing evidence. Must be 4-5 sentences. Provide concise summary referencing records.\n\nLet's write 4 sentences:\n\n1. The first study lists several validated clinical scales—CDR‑sb, ADAS‑cog14, Amsterdam‑IADL, FAQ, and MMSE—as primary outcomes measuring cognitive and functional status over 6 months. \n2. The second trial incorporates biochemical CSF markers (tau and amyloid‑β42), neuropsychological composites (NIHTB‑CB), neuropsychiatric inventories (NPI‑Q), coagulation indices (PT/INR), and the CDR score to capture disease biology and clinical presentation. \n3. The third investigation reports multiple pharmacokinetic parameters of RO7126209—including plasma and CSF concentrations, λz, Vss, Cend, various AUCs, T½, and clearance—that quantify drug exposure in the central nervous system. \n4. Together, these records enumerate eleven distinct biomarker types spanning clinical assessments, CSF proteins, neurocognitive batteries, coagulation assays, and drug pharmacokinetics.\n\nNeed 4-5 sentences; we have 4. Good.\n\nNow biomarkers array sorted maybe alphabetical? Not required. Just list.\n\nMake sure each element follows syntax: \"ACRONYM: expanded form of the acronym (or brief description if no acronym exists)\"\n\nThus:\n\n\"CDR-sb: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale – Sum of Boxes\"\n\"ADAS-cog14: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale 14 Item\"\n\"Amsterdam-IADL: Amsterdam Instrumental Activities of Daily Living\"\n\"FAQ: Functional Activities Questionnaire\"\n\"MMSE: Mini Mental State Examination\"\n\n\"CSF-tau: CSF Tau Protein (phospho tau p‑tau181)\"\n\"CSF-Aβ42: Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid‑β42\"\n\"NIHTB-CB: NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery\"\n\"NPI-Q: Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire\"\n\"PT/INR: Prothrombin Time / International Normalized Ratio\"\n\"CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating\"\n\n\"RO7126209-PC: RO7126209 Plasma Concentration\"\n\"RO7126209-CSF: RO7126209 Cerebrospinal Fluid Concentration\"\n\"RO7126209-LambdaZ: RO7126209 Terminal Rate Constant (λz)\"\n\"RO7126209-VSS: RO7126209 Volume of Distribution at Steady‑State\"\n\"RO7126209-CEND: RO7126209 Concentration at End of Infusion\"\n\"RO7126209-AUC0-168h: RO7126209 Area Under Curve 0‑168 h\"\n\"RO7126209-AUC0-LAST: RO7126209 Area Under Curve 0‑Last\"\n\"RO7126209-T1/2: RO7126209 Apparent Terminal Half‑Life\"\n\"RO7126209-AUC0-24h: RO7126209 Area Under Curve 0‑24 h\"\n\"RO7126209-CL: RO7126209 Total Body Clearance\"\n\"RO7126209-AUC0-INF: RO7126209 Area Under Curve Extrapolated to Infinity\"\n\nCheck duplicates: CDR appears twice; we keep one.

Also mentions MOCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) as measurement but it's a cognitive test, qualifies as biomarker? In previous examples, they included cognitive tests like MOCA? Not in examples. They included ADAS-Cog etc. So yes, MOCA is a biomarker. Also 11C-PBR PET scanning is imaging biomarker. But we need to list biomarkers explicitly present. We could list \"MARI: Microglia Activation Reserve Index\". Also \"MOCA: Montreal Cognitive Assessment\". Also maybe \"11C-PBR PET: Positron emission tomography with 11C-PBR ligand\" but acronym not given. Could use \"11C-PBR PET: 11C-PBR positron emission tomography\".

For ones without acronym, we can create abbreviation. Eg \"Amyloid PET Signal Intensity\" no acronym; we can use \"Amyloid PET SI\" maybe. But rule: always use acronym if available extracted from text even if appears in parentheses after full name. If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form. So for \"Amyloid PET Signal Intensity\" we can use \"Amyloid PET SI\". For \"Mini-Mental State Examination\" we use \"MMSE\". For \"T2 MRI\" we use \"T2 MRI\". For \"SWI MRI\" use \"SWI MRI\". For \"Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI\" use \"cT1w MRI\" maybe. For \"18F-Florbetapir\" we can use \"Florbetapir-18F\". For \"Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\" use \"SUVr\". For \"Blood-brain barrier opening volume\" use \"BBB opening volume\". For \"ARIA-E\" use \"ARIA-E\". For \"ARIA-H\" use \"ARIA-H\". For \"ADAs\" use \"ADAs\". For \"GAD-7\" use \"GAD-7\". For \"PHQ-9\" use \"PHQ-9\".\n\nMake sure each entry follows syntax: \"ACRONYM: expanded form of the acronym (or brief description if no acronym exists)\".

Biomarkers: flortaucipir PET uptake (SUVr), flortaucipir whole-body effective dose (radiation dose). Also cognitive assessments like DSST, ADAS-Cog, MMSE are not biomarkers? They are clinical scales. They are biomarkers too. The instruction says biomarker is quantifiable characteristic of the body. Clinical scales measuring cognition are also biomarkers. So we include DSST, ADAS-Cog, MMSE. Also flortaucipir SUVr. Also flortaucipir whole-body effective dose (dose). Also maybe \"Standard uptake value ratio (SUVr)\" itself. Also \"brain imaging of tau\" etc. So list: FLORTAUCI PR: flortaucipir PET uptake (SUVr). Maybe acronym FLT? But we can use \"FLORTAU: flortaucipir PET uptake (SUVr)\". Also \"SUVr: Standard Uptake Value Ratio\". Also \"DSST: Digit Symbol Substitution Test\". \"ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale\". \"MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination\". \"Whole Body Effective Dose: radiation dose estimate\".\n\nBut we must use acronym uppercase before colon. For flortaucipir PET uptake, acronym could be \"FLT-PET: flortaucipir PET uptake (SUVr)\". Or \"FLORTAU: flortaucipir PET uptake\". Use something consistent. The example uses \"Florbetapir-18F\". So we can use \"Flortaucipir-18F: flortaucipir PET uptake\". But flortaucipir is radiotracer. We'll use \"Flortaucipir-18F: flortaucipir PET uptake (SUVr)\". Also \"SUVr: Standard Uptake Value Ratio\". Also \"Whole Body Effective Dose: radiation dose estimate\".\n\nAlso \"DSST: Digit Symbol Substitution Test\". \"ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale\". \"MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination\".\n\nRecord 3: ATH-1017 study. Outcomes: ADCS-ADL23, GST, Plasma Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) Concentrations, ADAS-Cog11. Biomarkers: ADCS-ADL23 (clinical), GST (composite), NfL (plasma neurofilament light chain), ADAS-Cog11. So list: ADCS-ADL23: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living, 23-Item Version. GST: Global Statistical Test. NfL: Neurofilament Light Chain. ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 11.\n\nRecord 4: caregiving study. Outcomes: Perceived Stress Scale, Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist, CES-D. These are scales. Include PS: Perceived Stress Scale, RMC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist, CES-D: Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale.\n\nCheck if any other biomarker: None.\n\nNow compile unique list across all records. Ensure no duplicates.\n\nList:\n\n- Flortaucipir-18F: flortaucipir PET uptake (SUVr)\n- SUVr: Standard Uptake Value Ratio\n- Whole Body Effective Dose: radiation dose estimate\n- DSST: Digit Symbol Substitution Test\n- ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale\n- MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination\n- ADCS-ADL23: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living, 23-Item Version\n- GST: Global Statistical Test\n- NfL: Neurofilament Light Chain\n- ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 11\n- PS: Perceived Stress Scale\n- RMC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist\n- CES-D: Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale\n\nCheck duplicates: ADAS-Cog vs ADAS-Cog11 separate. Good.\n\nNow craft analysis sentence referencing evidence. Must be 4-5 sentences. Provide summary referencing records.\n\nLet's write 4 sentences: mention that records contain imaging biomarker flortaucipir PET uptake, cognitive scales DSST, ADAS-Cog, MMSE, plasma NfL, ADCS-ADL23, GST, etc. Provide concise.\n\nOk produce JSON.",

        "cot": "We need to identify biomarkers explicitly present in the records. Biomarkers are quantifiable characteristics. We look through both records.\n\nRecord 1:\n\n- Brain amyloid PET scan ([18F] Florbetaben PET). So biomarker: Florbetaben-18F? Actually [18F] Florbetaben. Use acronym: FLB? But we should use \"Florbetaben-18F\". Provide expanded form: tracer used in PET scan to assess amyloid load. Also mention SUVR, Centiloid scale. SUVR is a measurement metric. Should we list SUVR? It's a quantification method. Might count as biomarker: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR). Also Centiloid scale (CL). Both are metrics derived from PET. Also mention ARIA-H, ARIA-E detected via MRI. Those are imaging biomarkers: ARIA-H (hemosiderin deposition) and ARIA-E (edema). Also mention C-SSRS as assessment tool for suicidality. That is a clinical assessment tool, qualifies as biomarker? It's a measurement instrument. Yes, it's a biomarker: C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Also mention ADA (anti-drug antibodies) as biomarker: ADA assay. Also mention injection-site reactions (ISR) maybe not biomarker. But ADA is a biomarker of immunogenicity. Also mention \"Brain Amyloid Load\" measured by PET. So we have:\n\n- Florbetaben-18F: PET tracer for amyloid\n- SUVR: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\n- Centiloid Scale (CL)\n- ARIA-H: Amyloid-related imaging abnormality – hemorrhage (hemosiderin deposition)\n- ARIA-E: Amyloid-related imaging abnormality – edema\n- C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\n- ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody (titer)\n\nAlso mention \"MRI\" as modality but not a biomarker itself. Could include \"MRI-detected ARIA\" but already covered.\n\nAlso \"Injection Site Reaction\" is an AE, not biomarker.\n\nAlso \"Brain Amyloid Load\" could be considered a biomarker: \"Brain Amyloid Load (PET)\" but that's same as Florbetaben PET.\n\nAlso \"Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR)\" is a biomarker.\n\nAlso \"Centiloid Scale\" is a biomarker.\n\nAlso \"ADA assay\" is a biomarker.\n\nNow second record:\n\nBiomarkers:\n\n- C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\n- Vital signs: systolic BP, diastolic BP etc. Are these biomarkers? They are physiological measurements. Could list \"Supine Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)\", \"Standing 1-min SBP\", etc. But likely too many. The instruction says list biomarkers explicitly present. We can include \"Vital Signs\" as a category? But we might list each measurement? Probably just \"Vital Signs\" as biomarker? But the example lists each instrument separately. For vital signs, they didn't list each parameter. But we can list \"Blood Pressure (BP)\"? However, the record mentions \"Supine Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) >180 mmHg\" etc. That's a measurement. Maybe we can list \"Supine Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)\" as biomarker. Similarly \"Standing 1-minute SBP\", \"Standing 3-minute SBP\", \"Supine Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)\", \"Standing 1-minute DBP\", \"Standing 3-minute DBP\". But that seems excessive. The rule: collapse duplicates. But we can list each unique measurement. But maybe simpler: \"Blood Pressure (BP)\" as biomarker. But the record uses specific thresholds. I'd include \"Blood Pressure (BP)\" as biomarker.\n\n- ECG: \"QTcF Interval\" is a biomarker. So \"QTcF: corrected QT interval\".\n\n- Laboratory assessments: Hematology: hematocrit, hemoglobin, glucose, potassium, BUN. These are lab biomarkers. We could list them individually: \"Hemoglobin\", \"Hematocrit\", \"Glucose\", \"Potassium\", \"Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)\". But maybe too many. But the record lists them. We should list each.\n\n- C-SSRS again.\n\nThus list:\n\n- C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\n- Blood Pressure (BP): Supine Systolic, Standing 1-min, etc. But maybe just \"Blood Pressure (BP)\" as biomarker.\n\nBut the example didn't list individual vital signs. They listed \"Vital Signs\" as a category? No, they didn't. They listed \"Percentage of Participants With at Least One Potentially Clinically Significant (PCS) Change in Vital Signs Measurements;\" but did not list each measurement. So we might not need to list each vital sign. Instead, we can list \"Vital Signs\" as biomarker? But the biomarker definition: quantifiable characteristic. Vital signs are characteristics. So \"Vital Signs\" could be a biomarker. But we need to give acronym. There's no acronym. We could use \"VS\" as abbreviation. But the rule: always use acronym if available. If no acronym, create logical abbreviation or use shortest recognizable form. So \"VS: Vital Signs\" would work.\n\nSimilarly for ECG: \"QTcF: Corrected QT interval\".\n\nLaboratory assessments: \"Lab Tests\" maybe \"LAB\". But we could list each test: \"Hb: Hemoglobin\", \"Hct: Hematocrit\", \"Glucose\", \"K+: Potassium\", \"BUN: Blood Urea Nitrogen\". But maybe too granular. The record lumps them under \"laboratory assessments\". But we can list each as separate biomarker. Let's decide: list each.\n\nSo final biomarkers list combining both records:\n\nFrom record 1:\n\n- Florbetaben-18F: PET tracer for amyloid\n- SUVR: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\n- Centiloid Scale (CL): standardized amyloid burden scale\n- ARIA-H: Amyloid-related imaging abnormality – hemosiderin deposition\n- ARIA-E: Amyloid-related imaging abnormality – edema\n- C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\n- ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody\n\nFrom record 2:\n\n- C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (duplicate, keep once)\n- VS: Vital Signs\n- QTcF: Corrected QT interval\n- Hb: Hemoglobin\n- Hct: Hematocrit\n- Glucose\n- K+: Potassium\n- BUN: Blood Urea Nitrogen\n\nCheck duplicates: C-SSRS appears twice, keep once.\n\nNow ensure no duplicates.\n\nList in array order maybe alphabetical? Not required. Just list.\n\nMake sure each entry follows syntax: \"ACRONYM: expanded form of the acronym (or brief description if no acronym exists)\"\n\nFor those without acronym, we create abbreviation like \"VS\" or \"Hb\". Provide expanded form.\n\nLet's craft entries:\n\n- Florbetaben-18F: tracer used in PET scan to quantify amyloid load\n- SUVR: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\n- CL: Centiloid Scale\n- ARIA-H: Amyloid-related imaging abnormality – hemosiderin deposition\n- ARIA-E: Amyloid-related imaging abnormality – edema\n- C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\n- ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody\n- VS: Vital Signs\n- QTcF: Corrected QT interval\n- Hb: Hemoglobin\n- Hct: Hematocrit\n- Glucose: Serum glucose level\n- K+: Potassium concentration\n- BUN: Blood Urea Nitrogen\n\nDouble-check expansions: For K+, maybe \"Potassium\" but we can say \"Potassium concentration\". For Glucose: \"Serum glucose level\". For BUN: \"Blood Urea Nitrogen\".\n\nEnsure no duplicate acronyms: C-SSRS appears once.\n\nNow write analysis sentence: 4-5 sentences referencing evidence.\n\nLet's draft:\n\n\"The records describe several quantitative measures used to monitor disease biology and safety.

        "cot": "We need to identify biomarkers explicitly present in the records. Let's parse each record.\n\nRecord 1: D-PRESCRIBE-AD study. Outcome measurement titles list various percentages etc. Biomarkers? They mention \"percentage of participants who died\" (mortality), \"dose reduction\", \"polypharmacy\", \"emergency department encounters\", \"time to dispensing of inappropriate medication prescription\", \"ambulatory encounters\", \"hospitalizations\", \"non-acute institutional admissions\". Are these biomarkers? They are outcomes but not necessarily biomarkers. But the instruction says biomarker is a quantifiable characteristic of the body that serves as an objective indicator of biological processes or pathological conditions in AD. Mortality, hospitalization counts are clinical outcomes, not biomarkers. Dose reduction is medication dosage, not a biomarker. So likely no biomarkers in record 1. However maybe \"Medication-specific mean daily dose\" could be considered a biomarker? It's a pharmacokinetic measure but not typical biomarker. I think we should consider none.\n\nBut we might still include \"Mean daily dose\" as a biomarker? The definition: quantifiable characteristic of the body that indicates biological processes or pathological conditions. Medication dose is not a biological process. So exclude.\n\nThus record 1 yields no biomarkers.\n\nRecord 2: Western diet study. Biomarkers mentioned: APOE genotype (genetic biomarker). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured via ASL MRI. Also mentions CSF glucose and lactate levels (but that's in previous paragraph). Actually the brief summary says \"decrease in cerebrospinal fluid glucose and lactate levels.\" Those are biomarkers. Also \"blood pressure\" (systolic BP). Also \"cerebral blood flow\" is a biomarker. Also \"arterial spin labeling\" measuring CBF. Also \"global and regional CBF\" as outcome. Also \"CSF glucose\" and \"lactate\" are biomarkers. Also \"systolic blood pressure\" is a physiological biomarker. Also \"BMI\"? Not sure. But we should capture all explicitly present.\n\nLet's list:\n\n- APOE: Apolipoprotein E genotype (specifically APOE E4)\n- CSF glucose: Cerebrospinal fluid glucose level\n- CSF lactate: Cerebrospinal fluid lactate level\n- SBP: Systolic blood pressure\n- CBF: Cerebral blood flow (ml/100g/min)\n- ASL: Arterial Spin Labeling (imaging method, but it's a technique rather than biomarker; but the measurement of CBF is biomarker)\n- Maybe \"Blood pressure\" is a biomarker.\n\nAlso \"BMI\" is a metric but not a biomarker of AD.\n\nAlso \"lipid drink\" consumption is not a biomarker.\n\nSo we include: APOE, CSF glucose, CSF lactate, SBP, CBF.\n\nCheck if any other biomarker: \"Arterial spin labeling\" is a technique; but the biomarker is CBF. We can include \"ASL: Arterial Spin Labeling\" as a method, but not a biomarker. The instructions say biomarker is a quantifiable characteristic. So we don't include methods.\n\nAlso \"Cerebral blood flow change scores\" is a derived biomarker.\n\nThus list: APOE: Apolipoprotein E genotype, CSF glucose: Cerebrospinal fluid glucose, CSF lactate: Cerebrospinal fluid lactate, SBP: Systolic blood pressure, CBF: Cerebral blood flow.\n\nAny other: \"Blood pressure\" is same as SBP. \"Heart rate\" maybe but not listed. \"Height/weight/BMI\" not biomarker.\n\nOk.\n\nNow produce JSON with analysis referencing evidence.\n\nNeed 4-5 sentences.

Let's parse each record.\n\nRecord 1: CT1812 PK study. Biomarkers: CT1812 Plasma Concentration, CT1812 Total Radioactivity, AUC0-last, etc. But we need to list biomarkers as acronyms. For example: CT1812: compound? It's a drug, not a biomarker. But plasma concentration of CT1812 is a pharmacokinetic biomarker. Also \"Total Radioactivity\" maybe. But we need to list biomarkers explicitly present. The record lists:\n\n- CT1812 Plasma Exposure According to AUC0-last Pharmacokinetic Parameter\n- Plasma Total Radioactivity (TRA) Concentration CT1812-Equivalents at 168 Hours Timepoint\n- Cumulative Percentage of Radioactive Dose (Cum%Dose) Excreted in the Urine\n- Plasma Total Radioactivity According to AUC0-last Pharmacokinetic Parameter\n- Whole Blood:Plasma Total Radioactivity Partitioning Ratios\n- Plasma CT1812 Concentration at 96 Hours Timepoint\n- Cumulative Percentage of Radioactive Dose (Cum%Dose) Excreted in the Feces\n- Whole Blood Total Radioactivity (TRA) Concentration CT1812-Equivalents at 144 Hours Timepoint\n- Plasma M6/CP199 Concentration at 144 Hours Timepoint\n- Whole Blood Total Radioactivity According to AUC0-last Pharmacokinetic Parameter\n\nAlso outcome measurement description mentions LC-MS/MS, LSC, etc. But biomarkers are the measurements: CT1812 Plasma Concentration, CT1812 Total Radioactivity, AUC0-last, Cum%Dose, Partition Ratio, etc. Should we list them as separate entries? Probably yes. Use acronyms: CT1812: compound? Might use \"CT1812: plasma concentration\". But the instruction says use acronym then colon then expanded form. For CT1812, it's not an acronym but a compound identifier. Could treat as \"CT1812: compound\" but that's not a biomarker. However the biomarker is \"CT1812 Plasma Concentration\". So maybe \"CT1812-PC: CT1812 plasma concentration\"? But we need to use acronym if available. There's no acronym. We could use \"PC-CT1812: CT1812 plasma concentration\". But guidelines say if no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form. So we might use \"CT1812-PC\" or \"CT1812-Conc\". But we need consistency. Maybe \"CT1812-Conc: CT1812 plasma concentration\".\n\nSimilarly \"CT1812-TRA: CT1812 total radioactivity\". \"AUC0-last: Area Under Curve from time zero to last measurable concentration\". \"Cum%Dose: cumulative percentage of radioactive dose\". \"Partition Ratio: Whole blood to plasma total radioactivity partition ratio\". \"M6/CP199-Conc: M6/CP199 plasma concentration\". \"Urine Cum%Dose: cumulative percentage of radioactive dose excreted in urine\". \"Feces Cum%Dose: same for feces\". \"Whole Blood TRA: whole blood total radioactivity\".\n\nBut maybe too many. The instructions: collapse duplicates. Provide list of biomarkers. We can include main ones: CT1812 Plasma Concentration, CT1812 Total Radioactivity, AUC0-last, Cum%Dose, Partition Ratio, M6/CP199 Plasma Concentration. That seems fine.\n\nRecord 2: MK-8189 safety study. Biomarkers: Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), Number of Participants Discontinuing From Study Therapy Due to AE. Those are safety endpoints, not necessarily biomarkers but counts of adverse events. They are quantifiable. So include \"AE Count: number of participants experiencing an adverse event\" and \"Discontinuation due to AE: count\". Use acronyms: AE: Adverse Event. \"AE Count\" maybe \"AE: Adverse Event count\". \"Discontinuation-AE: discontinuations due to adverse event\". But we need to keep consistent. Maybe just \"AE: Adverse Event count\" and \"Discontinuation-AE: discontinuations due to adverse event\". But \"Discontinuation-AE\" isn't an acronym. Could use \"DAE: Discontinuation due to Adverse Event\". That's okay.\n\nRecord 3: NE3107 study. Biomarkers: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Change, fMRI change, ADAS-Cog change, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) change, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) change from Quick Dementia Rating Scale. Also mention \"neurophysiological health and oxidative stress using advanced neuroimaging analyses\" but not specific biomarker names. So include: MMSE, fMRI, ADAS-Cog, MoCA, CDR (from QDRS). Also maybe \"fMRI\" is an imaging biomarker. So list: MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination, fMRI: functional MRI, ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, MoCA: Montreal Cognitive Assessment, CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating.\n\nAlso mention \"QDRS\" but that's a tool, not a biomarker. But it's used to derive CDR. But we can include QDRS: Quick Dementia Rating Scale. But it's more of a tool. But still a biomarker? It's a clinical assessment. We can include it.\n\nThus final biomarkers list: CT1812-Conc, CT1812-TRA, AUC0-last, Cum%Dose, Partition Ratio, M6/CP199-Conc, AE, DAE, MMSE, fMRI, ADAS-Cog, MoCA, CDR, QDRS.\n\nNeed to ensure no duplicates.

For \"Zarit Burden Interview\" -> \"ZBI\". \"Caregiving Mastery Subscale of the Caregiving Appraisal Measure\" -> maybe \"CMS-CAM\"? But simpler: \"CM-SCAM\". Might be too complex. Maybe just \"CM-SCAM: Caregiving Mastery Subscale of the Caregiving Appraisal Measure\". \"Positive Aspects of Caregiving Scale\" -> \"PAC Scale\". \"Negative Affect in Differential Emotions Scale\" -> \"NADE Scale\". \"Meaning and Purpose\" -> \"MAP PROMIS\". \"Positive Affect in Differential Emotions Scale\" -> \"PADE Scale\". \"Percentage of Skill Pages in SAGE-LEAF Accessed by a Participant\" -> \"PSP-SAGE\". \"Sleep Disturbance\" -> \"SD PROMIS\". \"Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale - Difficulty\" -> \"OCBS-D\". \"Social Isolation\" -> \"SI PROMIS\". \"Willingness to Recommend SAGE-LEAF to Other AD Caregivers\" -> \"WR-SAGE\". \"Overload Sub-scale of Caregiver Reaction Assessment\" -> \"OS-CRA\". \"Anxiety\" -> \"ANX PROMIS\". \"Time\" -> \"OCBS-T\". \"System Usability Scale\" -> \"SUS\". \"Role Captivity Sub-scale of Caregiver Reaction Assessment\" -> \"RC-CRA\".\n\nBut these abbreviations might be arbitrary. The rule: \"If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form.\" So we can choose simple forms. Ensure uniqueness.\n\nHowever, we must avoid confusion. Perhaps better to use the initial letters of the full name: e.g., \"CPS: Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale\". That seems fine.\n\nLet's list each with abbreviation:\n\n1.
