    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They provide a long context from documents about Alzheimer's biomarkers. Then they give a list to validate: ['Tutto il dataset è stato processato.', '3MSE: Modified Mini Mental State Exam'].\n\nThey want us to check if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. Use JSON format per system instructions.\n\nWe must strictly rely only on the provided documents. So we need to see whether these items appear in the documents as markers.\n\nFirst item: \"Tutto il dataset è stato processato.\" That phrase appears at top of context: \"Context for Tutto il dataset è stato processato.: Citation: Gunes, S.;...\" It seems like a header or placeholder, not a biomarker. It's not a marker. So valid = false, acronym = \"N/A\".\n\nSecond item: \"3MSE: Modified Mini Mental State Exam\". We saw mention of \"Modified Mini Mental State Exam\" earlier. Let's search context: There's a line: \"Context for 3MSE: Modified Mini Mental State Exam: Type not listed\". Also later \"Context for 3MSE: Modified Mini Mental State Exam: 14–29. [32]...\". So yes, it's a test used in neuropsychology but is it considered a biomarker? The document lists many tests as measures, but the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context includes a table listing various measures, some labeled as \"PerfO\", \"ClinRO\", etc. The Modified Mini Mental State Exam (3MSE) is likely a cognitive test used for assessment. Is it considered a biomarker? Usually biomarkers are biological measures, but sometimes cognitive tests can be considered outcome measures. But the question: \"marker for Alzheimer's\" might refer to biomarker. However the context includes \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in...\" but also includes \"Cognitive Test Battery\" etc. The 3MSE is a cognitive test, not a biomarker. But the user wants to validate if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention 3MSE as a measure, but not necessarily a biomarker. The instruction says: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The 3MSE is a cognitive test used to assess cognition, but is it a biomarker? Might be considered a clinical assessment tool rather than a biomarker. The context shows \"Modified Mini Mental State Exam\" as a measure type \"Type not listed\". It doesn't say it's a biomarker. So maybe we should consider it not a biomarker. But the user may think it's a marker. The instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {original_name:..., valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\"}\"\n\nThus we should set valid=false for 3MSE too. But we need to provide acronym. The acronym is \"3MSE\". The context uses \"3MSE: Modified Mini Mental State Exam\". So acronym is \"3MSE\". Even though it's not a biomarker, we still provide acronym? The instruction: For each element, use JSON structure: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"ACR\"}. If not valid, \"acronym\":\"N/A\". So for 3MSE, since not a biomarker, we set valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\". But maybe we could argue it's a recognized marker? The context includes \"Modified Mini Mental State Exam\" as a measure used in studies. But the definition of biomarker: \"biological marker\" typically. The context includes \"fluid-based and imaging biomarkers\" but not mention 3MSE. So I'd treat it as not a biomarker.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n{\"original_name\":\"Tutto il dataset è stato processato.\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n{\"original_name\":\"3MSE: Modified Mini Mental State Exam\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nBut double-check: The user might expect 3MSE to be considered a marker because it's a cognitive test used to detect AD. But the instruction says \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The context references 3MSE but not explicitly stating correlation. But it's widely used. However the instruction says \"based strictly on the information provided in the documents.\" The documents do not state that 3MSE is a biomarker. So we cannot claim it's valid. So we mark invalid.\n\nThus produce JSON array. Ensure correct formatting.",

    },
    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They provide a list of potential Alzheimer's markers: ['MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging', \"ADCS-CGIC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\"].\n\nThey want us to analyze these using the provided documents. For each element, we need to output JSON with original_name, valid true/false, acronym string.\n\nWe must strictly rely on the provided documents. We cannot bring outside knowledge. So we need to see whether each item is recognized marker for Alzheimer's per documents.\n\nLet's examine the context.\n\nFirst item: 'MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging'. The documents mention MRI as a structural imaging biomarker. There is mention of MRI in many places: \"Context for MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging:...\", \"MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging\" etc. It says MRI is used as a biomarker for predicting disease progression. Also mentions \"structural imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease\". So yes, MRI is recognized as a biomarker. Acronym: MRI stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. But they might want the abbreviation used in documents: \"MRI\". So acronym: MRI.\n\nSecond item: \"ADCS-CGIC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\". The documents talk about ADCS-CGIC extensively. It's described as a tool used to assess clinically meaningful change. Is it a biomarker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" ADCS-CGIC is a clinical rating scale, not a biomarker per se. However, the documents treat it as an endpoint measure, not a biomarker. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker. According to the documents, ADCS-CGIC is used as an outcome measure, not a biomarker. The document states \"ADCS-CGIC is designed to assess clinically meaningful change\". It doesn't say it's a biomarker. So likely not considered a biomarker. But maybe the question expects that ADCS-CGIC is indeed a recognized marker? Let's read again: The user says \"List to validate: ['MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging', \"ADCS-CGIC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\"]\".\n\nThey ask: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nSo we need to decide if ADCS-CGIC qualifies as a recognized marker. The documents refer to it as an outcome measure, not a biomarker. But the user may still consider it a marker. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" ADCS-CGIC is correlated with Alzheimer's because it's used in trials for AD. But is it a biomarker? Usually biomarkers are measurable indicators of disease state. ADCS-CGIC is a clinical global impression, not a biomarker. The documents do not call it a biomarker. So I'd lean to marking it as invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check: The documents include sections like \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in AD clinical trials\" and then list \"CSF – amyloid beta (Aβ), CSF – tau, CSF – amyloid beta and tau ratios, Amyloid PET, Tau PET, Volumetric MRI\". ADCS-CGIC is not listed there. So it's not a biomarker. So valid = false.\n\nThus produce JSON objects:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging\",\n  \"valid\": true,\n  \"acronym\": \"MRI\"\n}\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"ADCS-CGIC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\",\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n}\n\nMake sure formatting matches required: Each element separate object? The spec says \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" Then shows example. Probably we should output an array of objects. But spec didn't explicitly say array. It said \"For each element, use this JSON structure\". Could output multiple JSON objects separated by newlines. But safer to output an array. But spec didn't specify array. Might just output each JSON object separately. I'll output an array of objects.\n\nLet's craft final answer accordingly.",

It's just a ratio used maybe in some imaging or spectroscopy contexts. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents do not present evidence that NAA/Cr is a recognized marker. So likely invalid. Acronym: \"NAA/Cr\"? But they ask for the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.

The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" BSR is a cognitive test, not a biological marker. But the context includes BSR as a measurement type.

There are many references to brain volume, hippocampal atrophy, volumetric MRI, etc. It seems that brain volume is indeed considered a biomarker for AD. The abbreviation might be \"BV\". But we need to confirm if the documents mention \"BV\" as an abbreviation. The context includes \"BV: Brain Volume\" at the top. So likely the acronym is \"BV\".\n\nBut we should verify if the documents mention \"BV\" elsewhere. There's \"BV: Brain Volume\" repeated.

Let's examine the context for each.\n\nFirst, DBP: Diastolic Blood Pressure. The context says: \"Context for DBP: Diastolic Blood Pressure: - medical-professionals/clinical-practice-guidelines-and-evidence.\" Then references include many about biomarkers, etc. But we need to check if DBP is considered a recognized marker for Alzheimer's in these documents. The context includes mention of DBP only in the heading \"Context for DBP: Diastolic Blood Pressure:\" and then some references. There's no explicit statement that DBP is a recognized biomarker for Alzheimer's. It might be part of risk factors? But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents do not explicitly say DBP is a marker. So likely invalid.\n\nSecond, NBV: Normalized Brain Volume. The context includes sections about NBV: \"Context for NBV: Normalized Brain Volume:...\". There is discussion about volumetric MRI, hippocampal atrophy, normalized brain volume used in clinical practice, etc. It seems NBV is indeed a recognized biomarker for Alzheimer's.

They want to see if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Must rely strictly on provided documents. So we need to check if these markers appear in the context and whether there is evidence linking them to Alzheimer's.\n\nFrom the context: There are many references about biomarkers, but specifically mention HOMA IR? Let's search mentally: The context includes \"Context for HOMA IR: Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance: hon L,\" then some citations. It seems like HOMA IR is referenced as a context heading. But do the documents provide evidence that HOMA IR is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? There's mention of \"Tracking pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease: an updated hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers.\" That might include insulin resistance as a risk factor. But we need to see if the document explicitly states HOMA IR is a marker. The snippet shows \"Context for HOMA IR: Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance: hon L,\" then references. It's unclear if it's validated. The user says \"Based STRICTLY on the information provided in the context above\". So we only consider what is present. The context includes references to HOMA IR but no explicit statement that it is a recognized marker. However, the context might imply that HOMA IR is considered a marker because it's listed under \"Context for HOMA IR\" and references to studies evaluating plasma Aβ etc. But those references are about amyloid beta, not HOMA IR. The context for HOMA IR appears to be just a header. Might be incomplete.\n\nSimilarly, CMRGlu: Cerebral Metabolic Rate of Glucose. The context mentions \"Context for CMRGlu: Cerebral Metabolic Rate of Glucose: res the awardee...\" and later \"Cerebral Metabolic Rate of Glucose: to the brain.\" Also references to imaging. It seems like CMRGlu is discussed as a biomarker. But again, is it recognized? The context indicates that CMRGlu is a measure used in AD research. But we need to decide if it's recognized marker per documents. Likely yes, because it's used in imaging studies. But we need to confirm.\n\nLet's examine the text: \"Cerebral Metabolic Rate of Glucose: to the brain. A recent study of damage to the microvascular network and neural microstructure of the retina has been reported in AD, MCI, and even preclinical AD [43]. Studies of human and animal models of AD have also revealed biochemical pathways that are altered in the retina during diseases, such as Aβ and tau deposition [44].\"\n\nAlso earlier: \"Cerebral Metabolic Rate of Glucose:... EEG techniques with bodily fluid biomarkers may offer a more accurate prediction of AD status [45].\" Not sure.\n\nBut likely CMRGlu is indeed a recognized biomarker for AD. HOMA IR maybe less certain. The context includes \"Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance\" but no direct link to AD. Could be considered a risk factor but not necessarily a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention HOMA IR in context but not stating it's a marker. So I'd mark it as invalid.\n\nNow acronyms: For HOMA IR, the acronym is HOMA-IR. For CMRGlu, the acronym is CMRglu or CMRGlu. The context uses \"CMRGlu\". So we can give \"CMRGlu\".\n\nReturn JSON array with objects.\n\nNeed to follow required format: For each element, use JSON structure: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"...\"}.\n\nSo produce array of two objects.\n\nLet's craft.\n\nCheck if any other acronym: For HOMA IR, the acronym is HOMA-IR.

There's mention of \"FPG: Fasting Plasma Glucose\" in the title of a journal article: \"Fasting Plasma Glucose: Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports 7 (2023) 355–380\".

It only references a paper. Without explicit confirmation, we might consider it invalid. But perhaps the presence of a dedicated paper indicates it's being investigated.

The document uses \"APOE ε4\". I'd say acronym: \"APOE\". Because that's the gene name. The allele is indicated by epsilon symbol.

It's likely not a biomarker; it's a measure of social support maybe. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" means a biomarker or measurement used as a marker. The context shows \"INFORMAL_HELPERS: Number of informal helpers\" as a measure type. But is it a recognized marker? The context says \"Number of informal helpers: Type not listed\". There's no mention of it being a marker. It might be a variable measured but not necessarily a biomarker. The user wants to know if it's recognized marker for Alzheimer's. According to the documents, there's no evidence that number of informal helpers is a recognized marker. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nSecond: \"CGIC: Clinical Global Impression of Change\". The context includes many mentions of CGIC. For example, \"ADCS-CGIC\" is described. Also \"CGIC: Clinical Global Impression of Change\" appears in the context. There is mention that \"ADCS-CGIC\" is a tool. The abbreviation \"CGIC\" stands for \"Clinical Global Impression of Change\". So yes, it's a recognized marker? Actually it's a rating scale used in clinical trials. It's a clinical outcome assessment, not a biomarker. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The context indicates that CGIC is used as an endpoint in AD trials. So it qualifies as a recognized marker. So valid = true. Acronym: \"CGIC\".\n\nBut the user also gave \"CGIC: Clinical Global Impression of Change\" as the original name.

They want us to analyze two items: 'SIB: Severe Impairment Battery' and 'ADCS-ADL19: Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (19-item)'.\n\nWe must determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use info from the provided context. So we need to see whether SIB is considered a marker. In the context, SIB stands for Severe Impairment Battery. It appears multiple times. But is it a biomarker? It's a battery of tests measuring severity of impairment. The context says \"Severe Impairment Battery: son BC, Atri A, Clevenger C, et al.\" It seems like a tool used for assessing severity. Is it a biomarker? Usually biomarkers are biological measures, but here it's a clinical assessment tool. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" According to documents. The document mentions SIB in context of \"no clinical recommendation could be issued based on such data\". That suggests it's used for detection of AD in MCI patients. But is it a biomarker? The glossary defines biomarkers as \"presence of extracellular amyloid-beta plaques and aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau...\". But SIB is a clinical battery. Not a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut maybe the context includes \"SIB: Severe Impairment Battery\" as a measure used in clinical trials. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention SIB as a measurement instrument. But is it a marker? The definition of marker might include clinical scales? The instruction: \"Your task is to analyze a list of potential markers extracted from datasets and validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" So we need to decide if each is a recognized marker. The context indicates SIB is used for detection but not recommended. It doesn't say it's a biomarker. So I'd mark as invalid.\n\nNow second: ADCS-ADL19: Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (19-item). The context lists many measures including ADCS-ADL. It is a measure used in trials. Is it a marker? It's a clinical outcome measure, not a biomarker. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents treat ADCS-ADL as a measure, not a biomarker. So likely invalid too. However, the user might expect that ADCS-ADL is a recognized marker because it's listed among endpoints. But the instruction says \"marker\" meaning biomarker? The context uses \"biomarker\" for things like amyloid, tau. ADCS-ADL is not a biomarker. So I think both are invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"Table 1: Contexts of use of biomarkers for AD clinical trials.\" Under \"Specific use in clinical trials\", \"Diagnostic\", \"Predictive\", etc. Then \"Key messages\" talk about \"Clinicobiological selection of participants... utilizing diagnostic biomarkers to confirm underlying pathology.\" Then \"Biological disease s...\" incomplete. The ADCS-ADL is listed under \"Selected primary and secondary endpoints used in AD clinical trials\". These are outcome measures, not biomarkers. So indeed not a biomarker.\n\nThus both are invalid markers per the documents. Provide acronym: For SIB: \"SIB\" itself.

    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want us to analyze two items: 'SIB: Severe Impairment Battery' and 'ADCS-ADL19: Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (19-item)'.\n\nWe must determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use info from the provided context. So we need to see whether SIB is considered a marker. In the context, SIB stands for Severe Impairment Battery. It appears multiple times. But is it a biomarker? It's a battery of tests measuring severity of impairment. The context says \"Severe Impairment Battery: son BC, Atri A, Clevenger C, et al.\" It seems like a tool used for assessing severity. Is it a biomarker? Usually biomarkers are biological measures, but here it's a clinical assessment tool. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" According to documents. The document mentions SIB in context of \"no clinical recommendation could be issued based on such data\". That suggests it's used for detection of AD in MCI patients. But is it a biomarker? The glossary defines biomarkers as \"presence of extracellular amyloid-beta plaques and aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau...\". But SIB is a clinical battery. Not a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut maybe the context includes \"SIB: Severe Impairment Battery\" as a measure used in clinical trials. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention SIB as a measurement instrument. But is it a marker? The definition of marker might include clinical scales? The instruction: \"Your task is to analyze a list of potential markers extracted from datasets and validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" So we need to decide if each is a recognized marker. The context indicates SIB is used for detection but not recommended. It doesn't say it's a biomarker. So I'd mark as invalid.\n\nNow second: ADCS-ADL19: Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (19-item). The context lists many measures including ADCS-ADL. It is a measure used in trials. Is it a marker? It's a clinical outcome measure, not a biomarker. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents treat ADCS-ADL as a measure, not a biomarker. So likely invalid too. However, the user might expect that ADCS-ADL is a recognized marker because it's listed among endpoints. But the instruction says \"marker\" meaning biomarker? The context uses \"biomarker\" for things like amyloid, tau. ADCS-ADL is not a biomarker. So I think both are invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"Table 1: Contexts of use of biomarkers for AD clinical trials.\" Under \"Specific use in clinical trials\", \"Diagnostic\", \"Predictive\", etc. Then \"Key messages\" talk about \"Clinicobiological selection of participants... utilizing diagnostic biomarkers to confirm underlying pathology.\" Then \"Biological disease s...\" incomplete. The ADCS-ADL is listed under \"Selected primary and secondary endpoints used in AD clinical trials\". These are outcome measures, not biomarkers. So indeed not a biomarker.\n\nThus both are invalid markers per the documents. Provide acronym: For SIB: \"SIB\" itself. For ADCS-ADL19: \"ADCS-ADL\".\n\nBut the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\"\n\nSo we output two JSON objects accordingly.\n\nLet's produce array?

The question: \"Based STRICTLY on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to look at the documents: The context shows that EQ-5D-5L is used as an endpoint in AD clinical trials.

The context refers to them as \"Outcome Measures\" rather than biomarkers. But the user wants to know if they are recognized markers.

However, the context includes \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in AD clinical trials\" section listing CSF amyloid beta, tau, etc. No mention of EQ-5D or NPI as biomarkers. So likely they are not recognized markers. But maybe the context uses \"markers\" loosely to mean \"outcome measures\". But the instruction says \"biomarker\". So I'd say both are not recognized biomarkers. But they are recognized outcome measures. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". I think we should interpret \"marker\" as \"biomarker\" specifically. So neither qualifies. But we can still provide acronym: EQ-5D-5L for first, NPI for second.

It's more a cardiovascular risk factor. The documents talk about blood biomarkers for AD, but not blood pressure. The context includes \"Blood Pressure: 37]\" referencing a citation. That seems like a formatting artifact. It says \"Context for BP: Blood Pressure:\" then lists citations. But no explicit statement that blood pressure is a marker. Similarly for heart rate.\n\nThus likely both are not recognized markers. However, we should check if there is any mention of blood pressure being used as a biomarker. The context shows \"Context for BP: Blood Pressure:\" followed by citations. But those citations refer to guidelines for blood biomarkers, not blood pressure. The text after \"Context for BP: Blood Pressure:\" includes references to blood biomarkers. But maybe the phrase \"blood pressure\" appears just as part of the heading. No evidence that it's a marker.\n\nSimilarly for heart rate: \"Context for HR: Heart Rate:\" then references. No mention of heart rate as a marker.\n\nTherefore both items are invalid markers.\n\nBut we also need to provide acronym. For invalid markers, acronym should be \"N/A\".\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n{\"original_name\":\"BP: Blood Pressure\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n{\"original_name\":\"HR: Heart Rate\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nBut the required format: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably produce array of objects. Or separate lines? The instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {... }\". Could output array. We'll output array.\n\nLet's double-check if there's any mention of \"BP\" or \"HR\" acronyms. The document uses \"BP\" as abbreviation for blood pressure. But that's not a biomarker. The user wants the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For blood pressure, the abbreviation is \"BP\". For heart rate, \"HR\". But since they're not recognized markers, we still mark valid false. But do we still provide acronym? The instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }.\" So acronym is N/A.\n\nThus final answer: array of two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separated by comma inside array. Ensure proper JSON.\n\nReturn only JSON.",

Use JSON format per system instructions.\n\nWe must strictly rely on the provided documents. So we need to see if 'WT: Body Weight' appears as a marker. The context includes lines like \"Context for WT: Body Weight: res the awardee...\" etc. It seems 'WT: Body Weight' might refer to something else but likely not a marker. There's mention of \"Body Weight\" but not as a biomarker. It's just part of a sentence about awarding. So it's probably not a recognized marker. So valid = false, acronym = \"N/A\".\n\nNext 'APOE4: Apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype'. The context definitely mentions APOE ε4 genotype as a risk factor and biomarker. It says \"APOE ε4 carrier ('ε41') or homozygote ('ε411')\" etc. Also \"APOE ε4 genotype\". So yes, it's a recognized marker. Acronym? The document uses \"APOE\" as abbreviation. But also \"APOE ε4\". The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" That would be \"APOE\". Or maybe \"APOE ε4\"? But the abbreviation is \"APOE\".

We must check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention neutrophil absolute and WBC counts but do we see evidence that they are used as biomarkers? Let's scan.\n\nThe context includes references to \"Neutrophil Absolute\" and \"White Blood Cell Count\". There are mentions like \"Neutrophil Absolute: Neutrophil Absolute: ance as evidence evolves.\" Also \"Neutrophil Absolute:... specificity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" That suggests that neutrophil absolute count might be considered a biomarker. But is there enough evidence? It says \"These recent results demonstrate the plasma p‑tau assays’ ability...\" Wait that's about p-tau. Then \"Other promising biomarkers... NfL etc.\" There's also mention of \"Neutrophil Absolute\" earlier. The text seems to include some placeholder or incomplete sentences. But there's a line: \"Neutrophil Absolute: d a specificity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" So yes, it's being presented as a biomarker with high specificity and AUC. So likely valid.\n\nNow WBC: White Blood Cell Count. Are there similar statements? I don't see explicit mention of WBC as a biomarker. The context shows WBC: White Blood Cell Count: ence, but no data. It's just part of the document header maybe. No mention of WBC as a biomarker. So probably invalid.\n\nBut we need to provide acronym. For Neutrophil Absolute, the acronym could be \"NA\"? But typical abbreviation is \"NEU\" or \"neutrophil count\". However the document uses \"Neutrophil Absolute\" as name. Acronym maybe \"NA\"? But we should look for any acronym in the context. Search: \"Neutrophil Absolute:\" appears only. No acronym given. Could be \"NAB\"? Not sure. The instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker\". Since the document doesn't give one, maybe we can infer \"NA\" but that might conflict with other acronyms. Alternatively we could say \"N/A\" if no acronym. But the requirement: If element is not valid, set acronym \"N/A\". For valid ones, we need an acronym. But if none provided, maybe still provide something? The instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker\". If not available, maybe \"N/A\". But that would conflict with validity. But we can still provide \"N/A\" if no acronym exists. But the instruction didn't specify what to do if no acronym. But logically, if no acronym is mentioned, we can put \"N/A\".\n\nHowever, for Neutrophil Absolute, maybe the acronym is \"NAb\" or \"NAbs\"? But not in text. Might be \"Neutrophil Absolute\" itself. But we can use \"NA\" as abbreviation. But I'm uncertain.\n\nLet's search again: The context snippet: \"Neutrophil Absolute: Neutrophil Absolute: ance as evidence evolves.\" That's weird. Maybe truncated. But no acronym.\n\nThus we might set acronym \"N/A\" for both? But then for Neutrophil Absolute we mark valid true, but acronym N/A? That might violate instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" If none, maybe \"N/A\".

And provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info in the context. So we need to see whether these items appear as markers in the documents.\n\nFirst item: 'Peripheral Edema Grade: Peripheral Edema Grade'. The context mentions \"Peripheral Edema Grade\" multiple times. It seems like a clinical measure used in some context. But is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context says: \"Large variability in use... strong reflect clinical trial outcomes... reflective of patient outcomes.\" It also says \"must be combined with amyloid biomarkers\". That suggests it's considered a marker? However, is it recognized as a marker? The text says \"Peripheral Edema Grade\" appears in the context but not necessarily validated as a biomarker. It's more like a clinical sign. There's no mention of it being a biomarker per se. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The document references peripheral edema grade as something measured, but not necessarily a biomarker. The context: \"Strongly reflects clinical trial outcomes and key features of AD; pre vs post change could be useful\". That implies it's used as a marker. But is it recognized? The context includes \"As it is measurable, it can show the level of decline, but it must be combined with amyloid biomarkers\". That indicates it's considered a marker. So maybe yes. But we need to decide.\n\nSecond item: \"CERAD-K: Korean version of Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease\". Is this a marker? No, it's a registry. Not a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nThus output:\n\nFor first: original_name: 'Peripheral Edema Grade: Peripheral Edema Grade', valid: true, acronym:??? The acronym might be \"PEG\"? Actually the abbreviation given is \"Peripheral Edema Grade\" itself. The acronym might be \"PEG\"? But the context doesn't provide an acronym. It just repeats the phrase. So maybe acronym: \"PEG\" is not mentioned. The instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For Peripheral Edema Grade, there is no acronym. So we should put \"N/A\"? But the instruction says if not a valid marker, acronym \"N/A\". But if valid, we still need an acronym. If none exists, maybe \"N/A\" too? But that would conflict. Maybe we can say acronym: \"PEG\" but that's speculation. Let's search context: I don't recall seeing an acronym. The phrase appears as \"Peripheral Edema Grade:\" repeated. No abbreviation. So we may set acronym: \"N/A\" even though it's valid? The instruction didn't specify what to do if no acronym. It says \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" If none, maybe \"N/A\". But then we risk marking as invalid incorrectly. But we can still mark valid true and acronym \"N/A\".\n\nBut maybe better to treat as invalid because there's insufficient evidence that it's a recognized marker. The context says it's used but not necessarily recognized. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context says \"Reflective of patient outcomes (assuming correct diagnosis of AD)\" and \"must be combined with amyloid biomarkers\". That suggests it's considered a marker. I'd lean to valid.\n\nHowever, the context also says \"Large variability in use depending on practice patterns in that area/expertise\". That might mean it's not standardized.

The tables show \"Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (C-SDD)\", \"Functional Activities Questionnaire\", etc. No GDS-K. So GDS-K is not present. Therefore invalid.\n\nBut we need to provide JSON objects per element.\n\nFor NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory -> valid true, acronym \"NPI\".\n\nFor GDS-K: Geriatric Depression Scale-Korean -> valid false, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nReturn array of objects? The spec says \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {... }\". Probably output a list of those objects. We'll produce JSON array.\n\nLet's craft final answer.",

      "valid": false,
      "acronym": "BAPINEUZUMAB"
    },
    "cot": "We need to parse the context. We have a long document snippet about MMSE, etc. Also mention BAPINEUZUMAB: Serum Bapineuzumab concentration. Need to check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to documents. The context includes many references to MMSE as a measure, but is it a marker? It's a test, not a biomarker per se. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" – In the context, MMSE is described as a performance outcome assessing severity of cognitive impairment, used for inclusion criteria in AD clinical trials. So it's a marker? It's a clinical assessment tool, not a biomarker like protein. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". However, the context lists MMSE under \"Measure name\" and type \"PerfO\" (performance outcome). They might consider it a marker. The question: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" So we need to see if the documents mention that MMSE is a recognized marker. Yes, the context states: \"The MMSE is commonly used for inclusion criteria in AD clinical trials. It is considered to be most accurate for classifying moderate stages of dementia.\" So yes, it's recognized. Acronym: MMSE stands for Mini-Mental State Examination. So output: original_name: 'MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination', valid:true, acronym:'MMSE'.\n\nSecond: BAPINEUZUMAB: Serum Bapineuzumab concentration. The context mentions BAPINEUZUMAB: Serum Bapineuzumab concentration: l for Alzheimer’s disease treatment; 2023. And there are multiple references to bapineuzumab. It appears to be a therapeutic antibody targeting amyloid beta. Is it a marker? The context refers to serum concentration as a measurement. It might be a pharmacodynamic biomarker. The question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The context indicates that serum Bapineuzumab concentration is measured, but is it a marker? It is a drug concentration, not a disease biomarker. But the context says \"Serum Bapineuzumab concentration: l for Alzheimer’s disease treatment; 2023.\" That seems to be a measurement of drug level. Not necessarily a disease biomarker. The question: \"Recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" – The context doesn't say it's a biomarker for disease progression. It is a drug concentration. So maybe not a marker. But the context also has references to BAPINEUZUMAB in relation to amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, etc. But still, it's a therapeutic agent. The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" The abbreviation is BAPINEUZUMAB? Actually the drug is called Bapineuzumab. The abbreviation might be BAPI? But the context uses \"BAPINEUZUMAB: Serum Bapineuzumab concentration\". So the acronym is BAPINEUZUMAB? Or just BAPINEUZUMAB? Usually the drug is called Bapineuzumab, no acronym. But the context uses uppercase. So we can set acronym: BAPINEUZUMAB.\n\nBut we need to decide validity. According to documents, is Bapineuzumab concentration a recognized marker? The context says \"Serum Bapineuzumab concentration: l for Alzheimer’s disease treatment; 2023.\" This suggests it's a measurement used in treatment monitoring. But is it a marker for disease? Might be a pharmacokinetic biomarker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents mention Bapineuzumab as a therapeutic antibody studied in trials. It is not a biomarker of disease. So I'd mark it as invalid. But we need to be careful: The context includes \"Serum Bapineuzumab concentration: l for Alzheimer’s disease treatment; 2023.\" That might be considered a biomarker of drug exposure. But the question specifically: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's.\" Could be interpreted as a biomarker for disease diagnosis/progression. Serum drug concentration is not a disease biomarker. So invalid.\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nLet's craft output accordingly.",

The user wants us to analyze two items: 'AUC0T: Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Last Quantifiable Concentration of Bapineuzumab' and 'AUCINF: Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time of Bapineuzumab'. They want to know if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. And what is the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly rely only on the provided documents. Let's examine the context. The documents mention AUC0T and AUCINF multiple times. They appear in the context lines: \"Context for AUC0T: Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Last Quantifiable Concentration of Bapineuzumab: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al.\" etc. Also \"Context for AUCINF: Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time of Bapineuzumab\". So these terms are defined in the documents. Are they considered biomarkers? The documents talk about biomarkers in general, but specifically mention AUC0T and AUCINF as measures of pharmacokinetics of bapineuzumab. Are they recognized markers for Alzheimer's? The documents might treat them as pharmacodynamic endpoints rather than biomarkers per se. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\" - we need to see if the documents consider them as markers. The context includes references to \"Area Under the Curve\" as part of measuring drug concentration over time. It might be used as a biomarker of drug exposure. However, the documents may not explicitly state that AUC0T or AUCINF are recognized biomarkers for Alzheimer's. They are more like PK parameters. But the user says \"based strictly on the information provided in the context above\". So we need to decide based on the context whether they are recognized markers. The context mentions \"Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Last Quantifiable Concentration of Bapineuzumab\" and \"Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time of Bapineuzumab\" as definitions. There's no explicit statement that they are biomarkers for Alzheimer's. But maybe the context indicates that they are used as markers in the context of drug development. The documents include \"BEST resource\", \"FDA context of use\", etc. But nothing else.\n\nThus we need to interpret: Are these recognized markers? The documents refer to them as \"Area Under the Curve\" metrics for bapineuzumab. They are used in drug development pipelines. They might be considered pharmacokinetic biomarkers. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents don't say they are recognized markers. They just define them. So I'd lean to marking them as invalid because there's insufficient evidence that they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's. Alternatively, one could argue that they are indeed biomarkers used in drug development for Alzheimer's. But the phrase \"marker for Alzheimer's\" implies something that indicates presence or progression of disease. AUC0T and AUCINF measure drug concentration, not disease pathology. So they'd not be markers of disease. So I'd mark them as invalid.\n\nBut the user also asks for the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. The acronyms themselves are AUC0T and AUCINF.

    "cot": "We need to parse the instruction carefully. The user wants us to analyze two items: 'AUC0T: Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Last Quantifiable Concentration of Bapineuzumab' and 'AUCINF: Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time of Bapineuzumab'. They want to know if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. And what is the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly rely only on the provided documents. Let's examine the context. The documents mention AUC0T and AUCINF multiple times. They appear in the context lines: \"Context for AUC0T: Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Last Quantifiable Concentration of Bapineuzumab: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al.\" etc. Also \"Context for AUCINF: Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time of Bapineuzumab\". So these terms are defined in the documents. Are they considered biomarkers? The documents talk about biomarkers in general, but specifically mention AUC0T and AUCINF as measures of pharmacokinetics of bapineuzumab. Are they recognized markers for Alzheimer's? The documents might treat them as pharmacodynamic endpoints rather than biomarkers per se. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\" - we need to see if the documents consider them as markers. The context includes references to \"Area Under the Curve\" as part of measuring drug concentration over time. It might be used as a biomarker of drug exposure. However, the documents may not explicitly state that AUC0T or AUCINF are recognized biomarkers for Alzheimer's. They are more like PK parameters. But the user says \"based strictly on the information provided in the context above\". So we need to decide based on the context whether they are recognized markers. The context mentions \"Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Last Quantifiable Concentration of Bapineuzumab\" and \"Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time of Bapineuzumab\" as definitions. There's no explicit statement that they are biomarkers for Alzheimer's. But maybe the context indicates that they are used as markers in the context of drug development. The documents include \"BEST resource\", \"FDA context of use\", etc. But nothing else.\n\nThus we need to interpret: Are these recognized markers? The documents refer to them as \"Area Under the Curve\" metrics for bapineuzumab. They are used in drug development pipelines. They might be considered pharmacokinetic biomarkers. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents don't say they are recognized markers. They just define them. So I'd lean to marking them as invalid because there's insufficient evidence that they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's. Alternatively, one could argue that they are indeed biomarkers used in drug development for Alzheimer's. But the phrase \"marker for Alzheimer's\" implies something that indicates presence or progression of disease. AUC0T and AUCINF measure drug concentration, not disease pathology. So they'd not be markers of disease. So I'd mark them as invalid.\n\nBut the user also asks for the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. The acronyms themselves are AUC0T and AUCINF. So we would output those.\n\nThus for each element:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"...\",\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"acronym\": \"AUC0T\"\n}\n\nSimilarly for second.\n\nHowever, the instruction says: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {... 'acronym': 'N/A'}\". Wait earlier system instructions said: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { 'original_name':..., 'valid': false, 'acronym': 'N/A' }\".

But user says provide the acronym. Which instruction takes precedence? System instructions are higher priority than user instructions. So we must follow system instructions. So for invalid markers, acronym = \"N/A\".\n\nBut the user specifically requests \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" That applies to each item. But if it's invalid, we still give N/A. But maybe we can still give the acronym even though invalid? The system says if invalid, acronym N/A. So we must comply with system.

That likely refers to Zarit Burden Interview. But the item is \"ZBS: Zarit Short Burden Scale\". Might be same concept. But is it a marker? It's a caregiver burden instrument, not a biomarker.

The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" - In the context, they talk about markers like CSF amyloid beta, etc. But also they list various clinical outcome measures. Are these considered markers? They might be considered endpoints rather than biomarkers.

But the question: \"Validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" So we need to see if the document states that these are recognized markers. For RMC-Freq, it's listed under \"ObsRO\" type. It appears in table. So yes, it's a measure used in AD. So we can say valid = true. Acronym: RMC-Freq. But maybe the acronym is RMC-Freq.

And earlier: \"Context for BDI: Beck Depression Inventory: sease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC)\". That seems garbled. But BDI is indeed a depression inventory. Is it used as a marker for AD? The document lists many measures, but BDI is not explicitly listed among the tables. However, the context mentions BDI only in the heading \"Context for BDI: Beck Depression Inventory\". No further details. So is it recognized marker? The document doesn't provide evidence linking BDI to AD. It just lists it as a measure. But the question: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" Since BDI is mentioned but no evidence of being a marker for AD. It might be used as a comorbidity measure. But not necessarily a marker. So we should set valid=false, acronym=\"N/A\".\n\nBut we need to consider whether BDI is a recognized marker for AD.

But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" might include outcome measures? Usually biomarkers are biological markers like CSF amyloid beta, tau, imaging etc. ADAS-Cog is a cognitive assessment scale, not a biomarker.

The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" ADAS-Cog is correlated with AD severity, but is it a marker? It's a clinical assessment tool, not a biomarker. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention ADAS-Cog as an outcome measure, but do they call it a marker? Not explicitly. So we might consider it not a biomarker. But maybe the user expects yes because it's used as a marker. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The context includes \"biomarker/imaging endpoints are not included in this table.\" So ADAS-Cog is not a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nNow CNTB: Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery. The context mentions CNTB as a type of neuropsychological test battery. It is used as an assessment tool, not a biomarker. So again not a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nBut the user might still consider them as markers. But we must follow the instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" Both are correlated with AD severity, but are they considered markers?

Let's examine the context.\n\nThe context includes many references to ADAS-Cog as an outcome measure, not necessarily a biomarker. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" might include outcome measures? Usually biomarkers are biological markers like CSF amyloid beta, tau, imaging etc. ADAS-Cog is a cognitive assessment scale, not a biomarker. However the context says it's used as an outcome measure in clinical trials. It may not be considered a biomarker. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" ADAS-Cog is correlated with AD severity, but is it a marker? It's a clinical assessment tool, not a biomarker. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention ADAS-Cog as an outcome measure, but do they call it a marker? Not explicitly. So we might consider it not a biomarker. But maybe the user expects yes because it's used as a marker. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The context includes \"biomarker/imaging endpoints are not included in this table.\" So ADAS-Cog is not a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nNow CNTB: Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery. The context mentions CNTB as a type of neuropsychological test battery. It is used as an assessment tool, not a biomarker. So again not a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nBut the user might still consider them as markers. But we must follow the instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" Both are correlated with AD severity, but are they considered markers? The context doesn't say they are biomarkers. They are assessment tools. The user specifically says \"potential Alzheimer's markers\". We need to decide validity based on documents. The documents don't label them as biomarkers. So I'd set valid=false for both.\n\nAlso provide acronym: For ADAS-Cog: the acronym is ADAS-Cog. For CNTB: the acronym is CNTB.

The documents mention many measures. Let's see.\n\nFirst, 'CSS: Cognition Summary Score'. In the context, there is repeated phrase \"Context for CSS: Cognition Summary Score\". But is CSS itself a marker? It's likely a composite score used in studies. The document says \"CSS: Cognition Summary Score\" appears in tables but maybe it's just a label for a composite measure. Is it recognized as a marker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" meaning a biomarker? But here CSS seems like a composite cognitive test score. The context shows it as a measure type. It might be used as an outcome measure. But is it a marker? The instruction: \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". So CSS may not be a biomarker; it's a composite score. However, the context indicates it's used as a measurement. But we need to decide validity based on documents. The documents show CSS: Cognition Summary Score appears multiple times, but no explanation of its validity. It might be a composite used in trials. But is it recognized? The context doesn't provide evidence that CSS is a recognized marker. It only lists it as a measure. There's no mention of it being a biomarker. So probably invalid.\n\nSecond, 'MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination'.

For DAD, it's described as a measure used in dementia, but not explicitly called a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents do not say DAD is a biomarker. They describe it as a functional outcome measure. So likely not considered a biomarker. But maybe the context includes \"biomarker\" usage?

So valid = false.\n\nBut the instructions: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {... }\". So we should output valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\".\n\nNow for 'Modified Crichton Scale: Modified Crichton Scale'. The context shows a table listing various measures including Modified Crichton Scale.

The documents mention MENFIS: Mental Function Impairment Scale. It seems it's a scale, maybe a measurement tool. But is it a marker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" meaning biomarker? The context lists various scales and tests. Some are cognitive tests, some are clinical outcome assessments. They might be considered markers? The instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". But the context includes many neuropsychological tests. Are those considered markers? Possibly yes, as they assess cognitive function related to AD. However, we need to see if the document explicitly states that MENFIS is a recognized marker. The context shows MENFIS: Mental Function Impairment Scale: Type not listed. It's part of a table of outcome measures. It doesn't say it's a biomarker. It is a scale measuring mental function impairment. Is that a marker? Might be considered a clinical assessment rather than a biomarker. The instruction: \"validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" So we look at the documents: MENFIS appears in the table. It is listed under \"Measure name\" with type \"COAa\"? Actually the table shows \"Measure name\" and \"Type of COAa\". For MENFIS: Mental Function Impairment Scale: Type not listed. That suggests it's not a recognized COA type? It might be a measure but not necessarily a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents don't label MENFIS as a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nNow ADAS-J Cog: It's also listed in the table. It appears as \"ADAS-J Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Japan Cognitive Subscale\". It is a variant of ADAS-Cog. The table includes ADAS-Cog variants. The context indicates ADAS-J Cog is a measure. It is a cognitive subscale. It is used in trials. It is a recognized measure. But is it a marker? It's a clinical assessment. The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For ADAS-J Cog, abbreviation is ADAS-J Cog. Or maybe just ADAS-J. But the document uses \"ADAS-J Cog\". So we should output that.\n\nBut we need to decide validity. According to documents, ADAS-J Cog is a recognized measure used in trials. It is a marker?

Let's examine the context.\n\nThe context includes many references to ADAS-Cog-11, ADAS-Cog-13, etc. It says ADAS-Cog-11 is a performance outcome and the most frequently used cognitive outcome in AD clinical trials. So ADAS-Cog-11 is indeed a recognized measure used in AD clinical trials. But is it considered a biomarker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" According to the documents, ADAS-Cog-11 is an outcome measure, not necessarily a biomarker.

But the user might consider it a marker. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" ADAS-Cog-11 is correlated with AD because it's used to assess cognitive decline in AD. So we can say it's valid.\n\nNow the second item: MacCAT-CR Understanding: MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research Understanding subscale. The context mentions MacCAT-CR Understanding subscale. It seems to be a tool used to assess competence. Is it a marker for Alzheimer's? The context doesn't mention it being a biomarker or associated with AD. It just lists it among assessment tools. There's no mention of correlation with AD. So likely invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes a table listing various assessment tools used in clinical trials and practice. Among them, there is \"MacCAT-CR Understanding\". The table shows type of COAa, disease severity, frequency, etc. It lists \"MacCAT-CR Understanding\" under \"Type of COAa\" maybe? Actually the snippet shows \"Context for MacCAT-CR Understanding: MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research Understanding subscale:\" then some lines about digit symbol tests etc. But the table earlier lists \"MacCAT-CR Understanding\" as part of the assessment tools.

So probably invalid.\n\nBut we should double-check if there is any mention of these items being used as biomarkers. Search for \"Risky Behavior Checklist\" in the context.

So we need to check if these items appear as markers in the documents. Let's search the context for \"MacCAT-CR\" etc. The context shows \"MacCAT-CR Reasoning: MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research Reasoning subscale\". That appears in the table. But is it a marker? It's a tool measuring competence. Is it a biomarker? No. The document says it's a subscale. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents mention many tests like MoCA, FCSRT, etc. Are these considered markers? They are cognitive tests, not biomarkers. But the question may treat them as markers? However, the instruction: \"Your task is to analyze a list of potential markers extracted from datasets and validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" So we need to decide if each is a recognized marker. The documents talk about various tests used as endpoints. Some are considered \"performance outcomes\" or \"clinical global impression\", etc. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" So we need to see if the documents consider these items as markers. The MacCAT-CR Reasoning subscale is listed among measures. But is it a marker? The document lists it under \"Measure name\" and \"Type of COAa\" maybe \"ClinRO\"? Actually the table shows \"Measure name\" and \"Type of COAa\" maybe \"ClinRO\" etc. The MacCAT-CR Reasoning subscale is listed as \"Type of COAa\" maybe \"Type not listed\"? Wait the snippet: \"Context for MacCAT-CR Reasoning: MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research Reasoning subscale: Type not listed\".

We must determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info from the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, we see many references to DORT: DriveABLE On-Road Test. It appears multiple times. For example:\n\n\"Context for DORT: DriveABLE On-Road Test: e 2. Selection of clinical endpoints depends on the stage of Alzheimer’s disease\"\n\nAlso later: \"Context for DORT: DriveABLE On-Road Test: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\"\n\nAlso: \"Context for DORT: DriveABLE On-Road Test: Type not listed\".\n\nAlso: \"Context for DORT: DriveABLE On-Road Test: to-decision procedures.\"\n\nSo DORT is referenced as a test. But is it a biomarker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The context indicates DORT is a driveable on-road test, presumably a functional assessment, but not necessarily a biomarker. However, the context might mention that it's used as a clinical outcome assessment (COA). But the user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention DORT as a test, but do they say it's a biomarker? There's no explicit statement that DORT is a biomarker. It's more like a functional test. So likely it's not considered a biomarker. But maybe the context says \"DriveABLE On-Road Test:... measurement of clinically meaningful changes also having varying challenges across the AD continuum.\" That suggests it's a measure, but not a biomarker. The user specifically asks: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". So we need to check if the documents refer to DORT as a biomarker. I don't see any mention of DORT being a biomarker. It's just a test. So I'd mark it as invalid.\n\nBut we need to consider the possibility that DORT could be considered a biomarker because it's measuring something related to AD. But the context doesn't call it a biomarker. It refers to \"clinical endpoints\", \"measurement of clinically meaningful changes\". It doesn't say \"biomarker\". So I'd mark it as invalid.\n\nNow for CDRS: Cognitive Dementia Rating Scale. The context includes many mentions of CDRS. It describes the scale, its usage, and its acceptance as a primary endpoint in early AD RCTs. It is definitely a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. So valid. Acronym: CDRS? Actually the abbreviation used in the document is \"CDR\" for Clinical Dementia Rating, and \"CDR-SB\" for sum of boxes. The user gave \"CDRS: Cognitive Dementia Rating Scale\". The acronym used in the documents is \"CDR\" or \"CDR-SB\". But the user wrote \"CDRS\". The correct acronym is \"CDR\". But the user asked: \"The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" So we should give \"CDR\" or \"CDR-SB\"? The scale itself is called \"Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)\" and \"CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB)\". The user uses \"CDRS\". But the documents show \"CDR\" and \"CDR-SB\". So the most known abbreviation is \"CDR\". So we will output \"CDR\".\n\nThus produce JSON array with objects for each original name.\n\nFormat: Each object has keys: \"original_name\", \"valid\", \"acronym\".\n\nFor DORT: \"original_name\":\"DORT: DriveABLE On-Road Test\", \"valid\":false, \"acronym\":\"N/A\".\n\nFor CDRS: \"original_name\":\"CDRS: Cognitive Dementia Rating Scale\", \"valid\":true, \"acronym\":\"CDR\".\n\nReturn as JSON array?

We'll output array of objects.\n\nLet's craft final answer accordingly.",

Actually they refer to \"HCI: Hippocampus Connectivity Index\". That seems like the abbreviation HCI stands for Hippocampus Connectivity Index. But we need to check if it's recognized as a marker for Alzheimer's. The document says \"Tracking pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease: an updated hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers.\" That suggests HCI might be a biomarker. But we need to see if the context explicitly states that HCI is a recognized marker. There's no explicit statement that HCI is a biomarker. But the phrase \"tracking pathophysiological processes\" implies it's used as a biomarker. Also there is mention of \"Hippocampus Connectivity Index\" in the table of measures. It's listed under \"Measure name\" maybe part of a neuropsychological battery? Wait the table lists various measures: Digit Symbol, etc. Not sure if HCI is in that table. The table shows \"Measure name\", \"Type of COAa\", \"Disease severity\", etc. I don't see HCI in that table. But earlier there's \"Context for HCI: Hippocampus Connectivity Index:\" repeated. So likely HCI is considered a measure.\n\nBut we need to decide validity: Is HCI recognized as a marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents? The context indicates that HCI is used in a paper tracking pathophysiological processes in AD. That suggests it's a biomarker. So yes, it's a recognized marker.\n\nNow what about CBF: Cerebral Blood Flow Perfusion. The context mentions \"CBF: Cerebral Blood Flow Perfusion\" several times. It appears in the context: \"Context for CBF: Cerebral Blood Flow Perfusion: ect the brain...\" etc. It also appears in the summary of identified studies: \"Cerebral Blood Flow Perfusion:...\". But is it recognized as a marker? The context refers to CBF as a measurement but not necessarily a biomarker. It might be a physiological parameter measured. The question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The documents mention CBF in relation to perfusion and possibly as a factor affecting biomarker levels. But do they say it's a marker? The text: \"Cerebral Blood Flow Perfusion: ect the brain and that may impact levels of a given BBM in ways that have not been well-studied (e.g., neurocysticercosis...)\" This suggests CBF is a variable that can influence biomarker levels, not itself a biomarker. But could it be considered a marker? The context doesn't explicitly label CBF as a biomarker for AD. It just describes it as a factor. So probably not recognized as a marker per se. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nAlso we need to provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For HCI, the abbreviation is HCI. For CBF, the abbreviation is CBF. But we need to confirm if the documents mention any other acronym. For CBF, the abbreviation is CBF. The context uses \"CBF: Cerebral Blood Flow Perfusion\". So the acronym is CBF. For HCI, it's HCI. So we will output JSON objects accordingly.\n\nWe need to produce a JSON array? The instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": true/false, \"acronym\": \"ACR\" }\". So we need separate JSON objects for each element. Probably output as a JSON array. The system instructions didn't specify array but typical. We'll output an array of objects.\n\nThus:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"HCI: Hippocampus Connectivity Index\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"HCI\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"CBF: Cerebral Blood Flow Perfusion\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nWait for CBF we set acronym to \"CBF\"? But if invalid, we set acronym to \"N/A\". The instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\":..., \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\". So we set acronym to \"N/A\".\n\nThus final answer.",

We must provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use info from the context above. So we need to see if the documents mention these items as markers.\n\nFrom the context: There's mention of \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory\" (NPI) as a measure. It appears in many places: \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)\" etc. It's described as a type of measure. But is it a marker? The context says \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)\" is a measure used in clinical trials. It might be considered a behavioral endpoint rather than a biomarker. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The context includes \"Biomarkers\" section: \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in AD clinical trials\" lists CSF amyloid beta, CSF tau, amyloid PET, tau PET, volumetric MRI. Also mentions \"APOE ε4\" as a risk factor. The NPI is not listed among biomarkers. It's a neuropsychiatric inventory measuring behavior. So likely it's not a recognized biomarker per se. But the question may consider it as a marker? The instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate...\". So we should decide if NPI qualifies as a recognized marker. The context shows NPI is used as an outcome measure but not necessarily a biomarker. The definition of biomarker: \"fluid-based and imaging biomarkers\" etc. NPI is not fluid-based or imaging. So I'd say NPI is not a recognized biomarker. So valid = false.\n\nBut maybe they consider \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory\" as a marker? The context says \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)\" is used as a secondary outcome. But the question: \"Recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The document references \"Biomarkers\" and \"Risk factors\" like APOE. NPI is not a biomarker. So I think it's invalid.\n\nNow APOE4: Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele. The context definitely refers to APOE ε4 as a risk factor and biomarker. It is used in enrichment. So yes, it's a recognized marker. Acronym: \"APOE\" or \"APOE ε4\"? The context uses \"APOE ε4\" and also \"APOE\" abbreviation. The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned: \"APOE\" stands for Apolipoprotein E. But the specific allele is \"ε4\". The context uses \"APOE ε4\" as a marker. So the acronym would be \"APOE\". Or \"APOE ε4\". The instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For APOE4, the abbreviation is \"APOE\". But the allele is \"ε4\". The context uses \"APOE ε4\" as a marker. So perhaps the acronym is \"APOE ε4\". But the instruction expects something like \"APOE\". Let's examine the context: It says \"APOE ε4 carrier (“ε41”) or homozygote (“ε411”)\". It also says \"APOE ε4\". So the abbreviation used is \"APOE\". But the allele is indicated by Greek letter epsilon. So the acronym is \"APOE\". But the allele is \"ε4\". The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For APOE4, the abbreviation is \"APOE\". But the allele is \"ε4\". Might be \"APOE ε4\". But the typical abbreviation is \"APOE\". But the allele is \"ε4\". The context uses \"APOE ε4\". So I'd output \"APOE\".\n\nThus produce JSON array with objects:\n\nFirst object: original_name: \"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\", valid: false, acronym: \"N/A\"\n\nSecond object: original_name: \"APOE4: Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele\", valid: true, acronym: \"APOE\"\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines? The required response format: For each element, use this JSON structure. Probably produce an array of objects.

The documents mention AST in some contexts: \"Context for AST: Aspartate Aminotransferase:...\". It mentions AST as a marker? Let's read carefully.\n\nFirst paragraph: \"Context for AST: Aspartate Aminotransferase: and PP patients were identified by the metabolite markers glucosylgalactosyl, hydroxylysine—H2O, and Glutamine-carnitine (discovery phase (DP) and validation phase (VP): area under the curve [AUC] = 1.000, AUC = 1.000 with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity). The MCI and AD groups were best discriminated with metabolite markers of alanyl-phenylalanine and phenylalanyl-proline (DP: AUC = 0.779; VP: AUC = 0.889). In addition, using positively confirmed metabolites, we distinguished AD from PP and MCI with good diagnostic performance (AUC > 0.8) [47].\"\n\nThen: \"Furthermore, changes in gene expression specific to AD have also been noted—the AD mark Early Onset Alzheimer’s Panel. Three genes (Apo E genotype, PSEN1, and PSEN2) can detect 45–90% of early AD patients [48]. Currently, none of these tests have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The test is based on the precise and robust quantification of the Aβ42/40 ratio (Aβ 42/40) and ApoE genotype in blood samples.\"\n\nThen: \"In another study, lactoferrin LF, a major antimicrobial peptide in saliva, was found in senile plaques and neurofib...\".\n\nThen: \"Other enzymes, hormones, or brain-secreted exosomal contents, such as proteins, lipids, and various RNA species found in blood or saliva, can have predictive powers...\"\n\nSo AST is mentioned but not necessarily as a marker.

For example, BACE inhibitors have been shown to decrease lymphocytes and increase alanine transaminase,125,126 which should be monitored when testing these medications.\" So AST is increased due to BACE inhibitors, so monitoring AST is needed for safety, not as a disease biomarker.\n\nThus AST is not a recognized marker for Alzheimer's per se. It's a safety biomarker for drug toxicity. So likely invalid.\n\nNow ALB: Albumin. The context includes many references about albumin? Let's search.

The documents mention AST in some contexts: \"Context for AST: Aspartate Aminotransferase:...\". It mentions AST as a marker? Let's read carefully.\n\nFirst paragraph: \"Context for AST: Aspartate Aminotransferase: and PP patients were identified by the metabolite markers glucosylgalactosyl, hydroxylysine—H2O, and Glutamine-carnitine (discovery phase (DP) and validation phase (VP): area under the curve [AUC] = 1.000, AUC = 1.000 with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity). The MCI and AD groups were best discriminated with metabolite markers of alanyl-phenylalanine and phenylalanyl-proline (DP: AUC = 0.779; VP: AUC = 0.889). In addition, using positively confirmed metabolites, we distinguished AD from PP and MCI with good diagnostic performance (AUC > 0.8) [47].\"\n\nThen: \"Furthermore, changes in gene expression specific to AD have also been noted—the AD mark Early Onset Alzheimer’s Panel. Three genes (Apo E genotype, PSEN1, and PSEN2) can detect 45–90% of early AD patients [48]. Currently, none of these tests have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The test is based on the precise and robust quantification of the Aβ42/40 ratio (Aβ 42/40) and ApoE genotype in blood samples.\"\n\nThen: \"In another study, lactoferrin LF, a major antimicrobial peptide in saliva, was found in senile plaques and neurofib...\".\n\nThen: \"Other enzymes, hormones, or brain-secreted exosomal contents, such as proteins, lipids, and various RNA species found in blood or saliva, can have predictive powers...\"\n\nSo AST is mentioned but not necessarily as a marker. But earlier: \"Context for AST: Aspartate Aminotransferase: and PP patients were identified by the metabolite markers...\" Wait maybe it's part of a larger sentence: \"Context for AST: Aspartate Aminotransferase: and PP patients were identified by the metabolite markers glucosylgalactosyl, hydroxylysine—H2O, and Glutamine-carnitine\" That seems odd.

Need to check if 'ALD: Aldolase' is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's per documents. Also 'BUN: Blood Urea Nitrogen'.\n\nFrom context: There are multiple mentions of Aldolase. Let's search mentally: The first lines mention \"Context for ALD: Aldolase: hon L,\" etc. It seems like Aldolase is referenced as a marker? But we need to see if it's recognized as a marker for Alzheimer's. The context includes citations referencing Aldolase: \"Context for ALD: Aldolase: hon L,\" then later \"Context for ALD: Aldolase: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al.\" Then \"Context for ALD: Aldolase: riers are at greater risk...\" So there are multiple contexts referencing Aldolase. Are they describing Aldolase as a biomarker? Let's examine the text: The snippet \"Context for ALD: Aldolase: hon L,\" maybe truncated. Hard to know. But likely Aldolase is considered a biomarker? The document might discuss it as part of a panel. But we need to decide if it's recognized marker. The context says \"Aldolase\" appears but no explicit statement that it's a recognized marker. Might be just a mention. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". We need to look for statements like \"Aldolase is a biomarker for AD\" or \"Aldolase levels correlate with AD\". I don't see such explicit statements. There's mention of \"Comparison of three analytical platforms for quantification of the neurofilament light chain in blood samples: ELISA, electrochemiluminescence...\" That's about NfL, not Aldolase. Another mention: \"Other promising biomarkers... NfL...\". No mention of Aldolase. So probably Aldolase is not validated as a marker in these documents. So set valid=false.\n\nNow BUN: Blood Urea Nitrogen. The context includes many paragraphs about BUN. It says \"Blood Urea Nitrogen: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". And \"BUN: d a specificity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82]\". That suggests BUN is being studied as a biomarker. But is it recognized? The context indicates BUN is being investigated as a biomarker. It says \"Blood Urea Nitrogen: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". That suggests BUN is part of biomarker profile. Also \"BUN: d a specificity of 93.3%\" etc. So yes, BUN is considered a marker. So valid=true. Acronym: BUN is already abbreviation. The most known/used acronym is BUN. So output accordingly.\n\nThus produce JSON array? The instruction: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably output array of objects. Provide each object. Use same order.

There's no mention elsewhere of creatinine being used as a biomarker for AD. The text says \"technology for the measurement of pTau-217.\" So creatinine is not a biomarker. It's just a word in the context. So likely invalid.\n\nSimilarly, CO2: Carbon Dioxide appears in the context. There are multiple sections titled \"Context for CO2: Carbon Dioxide:\" followed by various paragraphs about biomarkers, etc. But again, there's no mention that carbon dioxide is a biomarker for AD.

They want to see if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Must rely only on provided context. Let's examine the context for clues about whether chloride or creatine kinase are considered biomarkers.\n\nFrom the context: There are many references to plasma biomarkers like p-tau, Aβ, etc. There's mention of \"Chloride\" but likely just referencing a journal title? Actually \"CL: Chloride\" appears in the context: \"Context for CL: Chloride: The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease 12 (2025) 100056\". That seems like a heading indicating the abbreviation CL stands for Chloride. But is chloride used as a biomarker? The text doesn't mention chloride as a biomarker. It mentions \"plasma biomarkers\", \"p-tau\", \"Aβ\", etc. No mention of chloride levels. So likely not a recognized marker per documents.\n\nSimilarly, \"CK: Creatine Kinase\" appears. The context includes references to creatine kinase? Let's search. The context shows \"Context for CK: Creatine Kinase:\" then some repeated content. But no explicit mention of creatine kinase as a biomarker. The references include many papers about plasma phosphorylated-tau, etc. No mention of CK. So likely not recognized.\n\nThus both should be marked invalid. Acronym: For invalid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nBut we need to check if there is any mention of CK as a biomarker. The context includes \"Creatine Kinase: rkers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials.\" Wait: \"Creatine Kinase: rkers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation...\" Might be truncated. But maybe it's part of a paper titled \"Creatine Kinase: markers in Alzheimer’s disease\"? Let's read carefully.\n\nIn the context: \"Context for CK: Creatine Kinase: rkers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials. Lancet Neurol 21, 726-734.\"\n\nIt looks like a citation: \"Creatine Kinase: markers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials.

The context includes a reference to a paper about CK as a marker. But does the document itself say that CK is a recognized biomarker? The context includes many references to plasma biomarkers, but not specifically CK. The presence of a paper might suggest it's being studied, but not necessarily validated. The instruction says: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The context includes a paper that presumably discusses CK as a marker. That could count as documentation. But we need to confirm if the context explicitly states CK is a marker. The snippet: \"Context for CK: Creatine Kinase: rkers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials. Lancet Neurol 21, 726-734.\" That seems to be a reference to a paper titled \"Creatine Kinase: markers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials.\" So yes, CK is being investigated as a marker. But is it recognized? The context also includes other references about plasma markers predicting changes. But no direct statement that CK is a recognized biomarker. However, the presence of a paper suggests it's under investigation. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The paper qualifies. So CK might be considered a recognized marker per documents. But we need to consider the phrase \"recognized marker\" meaning established biomarker. The context includes many well-known markers like p-tau, Aβ, etc. CK is less common. But the presence of a paper indicates it's being studied. The question: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents;\" So we look at the documents: Are there any statements that CK is a recognized marker? The context includes a reference to a paper about CK as a marker. That implies it's being considered. But is that enough? The instruction says \"must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The paper is indeed a publication. So yes, CK is documented. So we can mark CK as valid.\n\nNow what about chloride? Is there any mention of chloride as a biomarker? The context includes \"Context for CL: Chloride: The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease 12 (2025) 100056\". That's just a journal name. No mention of chloride as a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nAlso we need to provide acronym. For CK, the acronym is CK. For chloride, acronym is CL. But the instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For CK, the abbreviation is CK. For chloride, the abbreviation is CL. But if invalid, acronym \"N/A\". But the example says: If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}.\n\nThus for chloride, we output invalid with acronym N/A. For CK, we output valid with acronym CK.\n\nLet's double-check if there's any mention of CK acronym elsewhere. The context uses \"CK: Creatine Kinase\" as label. So yes.\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate line? The required format: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably output array. We'll output array of objects.\n\nThus final answer.",

They want to see if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Must rely strictly on provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nThe context includes many references and some mention of biomarkers. There's mention of \"blood biomarkers\" and \"biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration\". There is mention of \"Direct Bilirubin\" in the context: \"Context for DBIL: Direct Bilirubin: - medical-professionals/clinical-practice-guidelines-and-evidence.\" Also \"Context for DBIL: Direct Bilirubin: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". It seems like DBIL is being discussed as part of biomarker profiles. But we need to check if it's recognized as a marker for Alzheimer's. The text says \"Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". That might refer to multiple biomarkers including DBIL? Not sure. The context also mentions \"DBIL: Direct Bilirubin: ance as evidence evolves.\" It's unclear.\n\nAlso there is mention of \"Gamma Glutamyl Transferase\" in context: \"Context for GGT: Gamma Glutamyl Transferase: lop it.4 A biomarker is classified into the susceptibility rather than prognostic category...\" etc. It talks about susceptibility biomarkers, mentions GFAP, genetic variants, but not GGT explicitly. Then later there's mention of \"Context for GGT: Gamma Glutamyl Transferase: Citation: Gunes, S.;... Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in the Current State: A Narrative Review.\" That article likely discusses various biomarkers, maybe including GGT? But we don't know if GGT is listed. The context includes a figure description: \"Figure 1. The pathogenesis and temporal changes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).\" It lists Aβ, tau, p-tau, brain atrophy, etc. No mention of GGT.\n\nLater, \"Context for GGT: Gamma Glutamyl Transferase: erging pathology in Alzheimer’s disease. EBioMedicine 76, 103836.\" That might be a paper about GGT? Actually the snippet shows \"M.V. Pais et al. / Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease [82]\" then a list of references. Among them, reference 82 is \"Comparing tau status determined via plasma Tau181, pTau231 and [18F]MK6240 tau-PET.\" Not GGT. So no direct mention.\n\nThus, we need to decide if each is recognized marker per documents. For DBIL: The context suggests it's part of biomarker profiles, but not necessarily validated. The phrase \"Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\" indicates that DBIL might be one of those biomarkers? But not explicit. The context also says \"DBIL: Direct Bilirubin: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". That might mean DBIL is part of such profiles. But is it recognized? Hard to say. The document might discuss DBIL as a biomarker. But we need to see if it's recognized as a marker for Alzheimer's. The context doesn't provide evidence that DBIL is a recognized marker. It just mentions it in the title of a table. Might be a candidate biomarker. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention DBIL in the context of biomarker profiles. That could imply it's considered. But we need to be cautious. The instruction: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above\". So if the context includes DBIL as part of biomarker profiles, that suggests it's considered. But we need to confirm if it's recognized. The context says \"Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". That might refer to a set of biomarkers, possibly including DBIL. But not explicit. The context also says \"DBIL: Direct Bilirubin: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". That seems to be a heading. Could be a subheading indicating DBIL is part of the biomarker profile. So I'd lean that DBIL is considered a biomarker. But is it recognized? The guidelines mention \"blood-based biomarkers\" and \"BBMs\". DBIL is a blood component. So yes.\n\nBut for GGT: The context mentions GGT in relation to susceptibility biomarkers, but not directly stating it's a recognized marker. It says \"biomarker is classified into the susceptibility rather than prognostic category\". That might refer to GGT? The context says \"Context for GGT: Gamma Glutamyl Transferase: lop it.4 A biomarker is classified into the susceptibility rather than prognostic category...\". That seems to describe GGT as a biomarker. But again, not clear if it's recognized for AD. The narrative review might mention GGT as a biomarker. But we can't assume. The context does not give evidence that GGT is a recognized marker. It only says \"biomarker is classified into the susceptibility rather than prognostic category\". That could apply to GGT. But we need to see if the documents mention GGT as a marker for AD. The context includes a citation of a review that presumably covers many biomarkers. But we don't have the content. So we cannot confirm.\n\nGiven uncertainty, we might mark both as invalid unless evidence. But the DBIL appears in a table of biomarker profiles. That might count as recognition. The GGT appears in a discussion of susceptibility biomarkers but not specific to AD. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The DBIL is mentioned in the context of biomarker profiles for AD. So likely recognized. The GGT is not clearly recognized.

Determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. Use JSON format per system instructions.\n\nWe must only rely on the provided documents. Let's examine the context. The documents mention \"Total Bilirubin\" in the context of \"TB: Total Bilirubin\". It appears in the text: \"Context for TB: Total Bilirubin: ance as evidence evolves.\" Also mentions \"Context for TB: Total Bilirubin: ect the brain...\" etc. But we need to check whether the document states that Total Bilirubin is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The text seems to discuss \"blood-based biomarkers\" but doesn't specifically say that total bilirubin is a marker. There's no explicit mention that TB is a marker for AD. It's just part of a discussion about emerging paradigms, biomarker combinations, etc. So likely it's not validated as a marker.\n\nSimilarly, Troponin I: The context says \"Context for TNI: Troponin I: d a speciﬁcity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" Wait, that's interesting. That line suggests Troponin I might have diagnostic accuracy for AD? Let's read carefully: \"Context for TNI: Troponin I: d a speciﬁcity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" That seems like they claim Troponin I can diagnose AD. But is that credible? The snippet might be truncated. But the phrase \"diagnose patients with AD\" indicates it's considered a marker. However, we need to confirm if the document indeed claims Troponin I is a marker. The snippet also includes \"Other promising biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease... The NfL is a component...\". No mention of troponin I elsewhere. But the snippet explicitly says \"Context for TNI: Troponin I: d a speciﬁcity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\"\n\nThus, according to the documents, Troponin I is presented as having diagnostic accuracy for AD. So it could be considered a recognized marker. But we need to ensure that the context is indeed referencing Troponin I as a biomarker. The snippet uses \"Context for TNI: Troponin I:\" then some description. So yes, it's a marker.\n\nNow, what is the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents? For TB: Total Bilirubin, the abbreviation is TB. For Troponin I, the abbreviation is TNI. But maybe the document uses \"Troponin I\" abbreviation \"TNI\"? Yes, the list items include \"TNI: Troponin I\". So the acronym is TNI. For TB: Total Bilirubin, acronym TB.\n\nBut we need to produce JSON objects for each element. Format:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"name as provided in the list\",\n  \"valid\": true/false,\n  \"acronym\": \"ACR\"\n}\n\nIf invalid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nSo for TB: Total Bilirubin, we think it's not a recognized marker. So valid: false, acronym: \"N/A\" or maybe \"TB\"? The instruction says: If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate acronym \"N/A\". So we do that.\n\nFor TNI: Troponin I, valid: true, acronym: \"TNI\".\n\nDouble-check: Are there any other references to TB or TNI? The context shows \"Context for TB: Total Bilirubin: ance as evidence evolves.\" Might be incomplete. But no mention of TB as a marker. So invalid.\n\nAlso note that the user wants \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For TB: Total Bilirubin, the abbreviation is TB. But because it's invalid, we put \"N/A\". For TNI: Troponin I, abbreviation is TNI.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"TB: Total Bilirubin\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"TNI: Troponin I\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"TNI\"}\n]\n\nBut the required format: For each element, use JSON structure. Possibly separate objects, not array? The system instructions: \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {... }\". It didn't specify array. But typical answer would be a list of JSON objects. We'll output an array of objects.\n\nLet's craft final answer accordingly.",

Also later: \"Urea: ns and delusions start...\". There's also mention of \"Urea: d a specificity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" So appears Urea is being considered as a biomarker? But we need to check if it's recognized marker. The context says \"Urea: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". That suggests Urea might be part of biomarker profile. But is Urea itself a recognized marker? It seems maybe used as a biomarker but not necessarily central. The text mentions \"Urea: d a specificity of 93.3%\" etc. So likely yes, Urea is considered a marker in the document. But we need to confirm if it's recognized. The context includes \"Urea:...\". There is no explicit statement that Urea is a recognized marker, but it's listed among biomarkers. The question: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" So we need to decide if Urea qualifies as recognized marker. The context shows Urea is discussed as a biomarker. So I'd say valid = true. Acronym: The abbreviation given is \"UREA: Urea\". But the acronym could just be \"UREA\". They want the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For Urea, the abbreviation is \"UREA\". So output: {\"original_name\":\"UREA: Urea\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"UREA\"}.\n\nNow WBC: White Blood Cell Count. Is WBC a recognized marker?

There's mention of \"blood-based biomarkers\" generally, but specific markers like plasma pTau-217, etc. But RBC count and hemoglobin are not listed. So likely they are not recognized markers per these documents. Therefore we should set valid=false, acronym=\"N/A\".\n\nBut we also need to provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For RBC: Red Blood Cell Count, the abbreviation is RBC. For HGB: Hemoglobin, abbreviation HGB. However, if it's not a recognized marker, we still might give acronym? The instruction says: If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}.\n\nThus we output two JSON objects accordingly.\n\nCheck if there is any mention of RBC or HGB in the text. Search quickly: In the context, I saw \"Red Blood Cell Count:\" appears in the heading but maybe just part of formatting. It doesn't say it's a biomarker. It's just a header. No evidence linking RBC count to AD. Similarly HGB appears only as part of heading. So invalid.\n\nThus produce:\n\n[\n{\"original_name\":\"RBC: Red Blood Cell Count\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n{\"original_name\":\"HGB: Hemoglobin\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nReturn as JSON array? The required format: For each element, use JSON structure. They didn't specify array but likely multiple objects separated. We'll output array.\n\nLet's craft final.",

But the document uses PLT as abbreviation for Platelet Count. They talk about platelet tau pattern correlates with cognitive status. So PLT: Platelet Count might be considered a marker? The question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The documents discuss platelet tau as a biomarker, but do they say platelet count itself is a marker? Not explicitly. They refer to platelet tau pattern. But the abbreviation PLT is used for Platelet Count. The context indicates \"Context for PLT: Platelet Count:\" then lists references. So likely PLT is a marker? The context shows platelet tau pattern correlates with cognitive status. That suggests platelet tau is a marker. But the abbreviation PLT refers to Platelet Count.

Platelet Count itself may not be directly a marker, but it's part of the platelet measurement.

That seems like a header. It doesn't state it's a marker. It's just referencing the test name. Similarly for TMT-B.\n\nLater: \"Context for TMT-B:... measurement of pTau-217.\" Not TMT-B itself.\n\nAlso there is mention of \"biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease\" and \"blood-based biomarkers\" etc. But TMT-A/B are not listed among biomarkers. They are neuropsychological tests used for cognitive assessment, not biomarkers. The documents don't explicitly label them as biomarkers. So likely they are not recognized markers according to the documents.\n\nThus we should mark them as invalid. For acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nBut maybe the acronym could be \"TMT-A\" and \"TMT-B\"? The user wants the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. The documents refer to them as \"TMT-A: Trail Making Test Part A\" and \"TMT-B: Trail Making Test Part B\". So the abbreviation is \"TMT-A\" and \"TMT-B\". But if we mark them invalid, we still need to provide acronym field. According to instruction: If element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}.\n\nSo we should output two objects accordingly.\n\nLet's double-check if there's any mention that TMT-A/B are used as biomarkers.

    "cot": "We need to parse the context. We have two items: 'NPI-10: Neuropsychiatric Inventory‑10' and 'MMSE: Mini‑Mental State Examination'.\n\nWe need to check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to documents. The documents mention many measures. Let's see.\n\nFrom the context: There is mention of \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory‑10\" in some lines: \"Context for NPI-10: Neuropsychiatric Inventory‑10: Type not listed\". Also later: \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q)\" etc. But we need to confirm if NPI-10 is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. In the document, there is mention of \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory‑10\" but no explicit statement that it's a biomarker. It's a neuropsychiatric inventory measure. Usually, NPI-10 might be a short version of NPI. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" meaning biomarker? The context includes fluid-based and imaging biomarkers like CSF amyloid beta, tau, etc. But also includes clinical outcome assessments. The instruction says \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". So maybe only fluid-based and imaging biomarkers count. However, the context lists many clinical scales. They may be considered endpoints rather than biomarkers. But the instruction: \"validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" So we just look at whether the documents say these are recognized markers. For NPI-10, the document mentions it as a measure but doesn't explicitly call it a biomarker. It appears in Table 1: \"Measure name... Type of COAa... Disease severity... Frequency...\" It lists NPI-10? Actually earlier: \"Context for NPI-10: Neuropsychiatric Inventory‑10: Type not listed\". That suggests it's a measure but type not listed. Not necessarily a biomarker. There's also \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q)\". But again, not a biomarker.\n\nThus likely NPI-10 is not a recognized biomarker per the documents. So valid = false.\n\nFor MMSE: The document clearly states \"Mini‑Mental State Examination (MMSE)\" and describes its use. It is widely used as a cognitive test. Is it a biomarker? It's a clinical assessment, not a biomarker. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents treat MMSE as a measurement tool, not a biomarker. But the instruction: \"Marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". The context includes both clinical outcome measures and biomarkers. But the term \"marker\" could refer to any indicator, including clinical scales. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The MMSE is correlated with Alzheimer's. So yes, it's a recognized marker. So valid = true.\n\nNow acronyms: For NPI-10: The acronym is NPI-10 itself. But the document uses \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory‑10\". The abbreviation is NPI-10. For MMSE: The acronym is MMSE.\n\nBut the instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker\". For NPI-10, the acronym is NPI-10. For MMSE, it's MMSE.\n\nReturn JSON array with objects.\n\nLet's produce:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"NPI-10: Neuropsychiatric Inventory‑10\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"MMSE: Mini‑Mental State Examination\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"MMSE\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate.

It seems it's a clinical outcome assessment, not a biomarker. But the question says \"marker\" meaning maybe they consider it as a marker? The instruction: \"Your task is to analyze a list of potential markers extracted from datasets and validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" So we need to check if each element is actually a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's. The documents mention DAD as a disability assessment for dementia, not necessarily a biomarker. It's a clinical outcome assessment. The question: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate...\".

Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, ADAS-Cog: It's clearly described as a cognitive assessment scale used in AD clinical trials. It is a measurement tool, not a biomarker per se? But the question says \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The context includes mention that ADAS-Cog is a performance outcome and widely used cognitive outcome in AD clinical trials. So yes, it's considered a marker (though not a biomarker like amyloid). The documents mention \"ADAS-Cog\" abbreviation. So we should say valid: true, acronym: \"ADAS-Cog\".\n\nSecond, HR: Heart Rate. The context mentions HR: Heart Rate in some sections about heart rate measurement technology for pTau-217? Wait, there is mention: \"technology for the measurement of pTau-217.\" That is a biomarker. But HR: Heart Rate is just a physiological parameter. There's no mention that HR is a marker for Alzheimer's. The context includes \"HR: Heart Rate:\" in some lines but likely referencing a heading. No evidence that HR is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. So we mark invalid: false, acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nBut we need to check if there's any mention of HR being used as a marker. Search context: There is \"HR: Heart Rate:\" line near \"Context for HR: Heart Rate:...\". It seems to be part of a header for a section about heart rate. But no mention of HR as a marker. So invalid.\n\nThus output JSON array with objects for each element.\n\nNeed to follow required response format: For each element, use JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"name as provided in the list\",\n  \"valid\": true/false,\n  \"acronym\": \"ACR\"\n}\n\nIf invalid: acronym \"N/A\".\n\nSo produce array?

But again, scanning the text: There is a line \"Context for HbA1c: Glycosylated Haemoglobin:...\". But no mention of HbA1c being a biomarker for Alzheimer's. The document appears to talk about blood-based biomarkers like plasma pTau-217, Aβ, etc. Not HbA1c. So it's not a recognized marker.\n\nThus both items are invalid.\n\nBut we need to produce JSON objects for each element.

So we set acronym \"APOE\".\n\nFor ALT: Alanine Aminotransferase. The context includes mention of ALT as a biomarker? Let's search. The context says \"ALT: Alanine Aminotransferase: riers are at greater risk...\" Wait there is some garbled text: \"ALT: Alanine Aminotransferase: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That seems like a fragment. It also mentions \"BACE inhibitors have been shown to decrease lymphocytes and increase alanine transaminase,125,126 which should be monitored when testing these medications.\" So ALT is mentioned as a biomarker for monitoring toxicity.

The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents;\" The context says ALT is a biomarker for safety monitoring in anti-Aβ therapies, but not specifically a marker for AD pathology. It's a general liver enzyme. The context doesn't say it's a marker for AD. So probably not considered a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. Therefore valid = false, acronym = \"N/A\".\n\nBut let's check if there's any mention of ALT being used as a biomarker for AD. The context: \"ALT: Alanine Aminotransferase: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.124 The need for additional drug- or class-specific safety biomarkers may arise with different drug targets/mechanisms. For example, BACE inhibitors have been shown to decrease lymphocytes and increase alanine transaminase,125,126 which should be monitored when testing these medications.\" So ALT is a safety biomarker, not a disease biomarker.

The documents mention ADCS-CGIC multiple times. It is described as a clinical global impression scale used in AD trials. Is it a biomarker? It's an endpoint measure, not a biomarker per se. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" maybe includes clinical rating scales? The context says \"ADCS-CGIC is designed to assess clinically meaningful change\". It is used as an outcome measure. The document also lists \"ADCS-CGIC\" under glossary. So it's recognized as a measure. But is it a biomarker? The instruction: \"Your task is to analyze a list of potential markers extracted from datasets and validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" They want to know if it's a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's. The ADCS-CGIC is a clinical rating scale, not a biomarker like CSF or imaging. However, the context might treat it as a marker. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" ADCS-CGIC is used in AD trials, so yes. But is it a biomarker?

We have two items: 'SCB: Screen for Caregiver Burden' and 'MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination'.\n\nWe need to check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to documents. The documents mention SCB: Screen for Caregiver Burden. Let's search context: In the text, there is \"Screen for Caregiver Burden\" abbreviation SCB. It appears in the first paragraph: \"Context for SCB: Screen for Caregiver Burden: ase severity, ranging from 1-2 points...\" So SCB is defined as Screen for Caregiver Burden. But is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The document seems to discuss SCB as a measure of caregiver burden, not necessarily a biomarker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". Markers can be biomarkers or clinical measures? The instruction says \"expert in Alzheimer's markers (and biomarkers).\" They want to validate if it's a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's. SCB is a caregiver burden screen, not a biological marker. It's a clinical tool but not a biomarker. The context indicates it's used to evaluate caregiver burden, not directly a marker of disease pathology. So likely invalid.\n\nBut we should confirm: The context includes \"Screen for Caregiver Burden\" as part of measurement. It may be used as an endpoint in trials. But is it a recognized marker? The instruction: \"marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" SCB is not a biomarker; it's a caregiver burden measure. There's no mention of correlation with Alzheimer's pathology. So invalid.\n\nNow MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination. The context has many references about MMSE. It is widely used for assessing cognitive impairment, classification of dementia severity. It is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. So valid. Acronym: MMSE.

The context says TOS is a measurement tool, not necessarily a biomarker. But the user wants to know if it's a recognized marker. According to the documents, TOS is used as an outcome measure, not a biomarker. However, the context includes \"TOS: Treatment Outcome Scale\" as part of the list.

So we mark as invalid.\n\nNow SIB: Severe Impairment Battery. The context includes SIB: Severe Impairment Battery. It is a battery used to assess severe AD.

And \"SIB: Severe Impairment Battery: curacy in detecting AD in MCI patients found exceedingly large variability of results and concluded that no clinical recommendation could be issued based on such data [17].\" So SIB is a clinical assessment tool, not a biomarker. But the user wants to know if it's a recognized marker. According to the documents, SIB is a clinical assessment tool used to detect AD severity. It is not a biomarker. So we mark as invalid too.\n\nHowever, the user might consider these as markers? The instruction: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" So we need to output JSON objects accordingly.\n\nThus:\n\nFirst object: original_name: \"TOS: Treatment Outcome Scale\", valid: false, acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nSecond object: original_name: \"SIB: Severe Impairment Battery\", valid: false, acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nBut wait: The acronym for SIB is \"SIB\".

So both would be invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"Individual biomarkers summarized\" section listing CSF amyloid beta, tau, etc. No mention of ADRQL or DAD. There's also \"Individual endpoints summarized\" sections. Those include ADRQL, DAD, etc. But the question: \"Recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents talk about ADRQL and DAD as endpoints, not biomarkers. So they are not recognized markers. So valid should be false for both.\n\nNow acronyms: For ADRQL, the acronym is ADRQL itself. For DAD, acronym is DAD. But since they're invalid, we set acronym \"N/A\". Wait the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\"\n\nThus for both items, we produce that.\n\nHowever, maybe the user expects that ADRQL and DAD are recognized markers because they are used in AD trials. But the instruction says \"marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The context shows they are used in AD trials, but not necessarily correlated. But they are endpoints measuring aspects of AD. Are they considered markers? The term \"marker\" could be broader. But the earlier instruction: \"You are an expert in Alzheimer's markers (and biomarkers).\" So likely they mean biomarkers. The context includes \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in AD clinical trials\" and \"Individual biomarkers summarized\". That section lists CSF amyloid beta, tau, etc. So ADRQL and DAD are not in that list. So they are not biomarkers.\n\nThus we will output two JSON objects with valid false and acronym N/A.\n\nLet's craft the JSON array. The required format: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably output an array of objects. The system instructions didn't specify array vs separate lines. Usually they'd expect an array. We'll output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"ADRQL: Alzheimer Disease-related Quality of Life\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"DAD: Disability Assessment in Dementia\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nMake sure keys match exactly: \"original_name\", \"valid\", \"acronym\". Ensure boolean values are lowercase true/false. Good.\n\nCheck that we didn't miss anything else. The context also has \"ADRQL: Alzheimer Disease-related Quality of Life\" appears multiple times. The acronym is ADRQL. But we still mark invalid. The user asked: \"If a marker is NOT a valid marker, indicate:... acronym: 'N/A'\". So yes.\n\nReturn just the JSON.",

But is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? In the document, it's listed among measures used in clinical trials, but not necessarily a biomarker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" meaning biomarker? The context says \"biomarker\" refers to core AD biomarkers like amyloid beta, tau etc. WAIS Block Design is a neuropsych test, not a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut we need to check if the documents mention WAIS Block Design as a marker. The context includes \"WAIS Block Design: Type not listed\" and \"WAIS Block Design: pathology to define clinical AD but also categorize individuals with positive tau and negative Aβ as belonging to the continuum of non-AD progressive neurodegenerative disorders.\" That suggests WAIS Block Design is used in context of diagnosing people with MCI, but not a biomarker itself.

It's a cognitive test, not a biomarker. But the question: \"marker for Alzheimer's\" could include cognitive assessments? Usually markers refer to biological markers. However, the context lists MMSE as a measure. The question: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nSo we need to see if the documents consider MMSE a marker. The context says \"The MMSE is commonly used for inclusion criteria in AD clinical trials. It is considered to be most accurate for classifying moderate stages of dementia.\" It doesn't say it's a biomarker. But maybe it's considered a marker? The question might treat any measurement used to assess AD as a marker. But the instruction earlier: \"Your task is to analyze a list of potential markers extracted from datasets and validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" So markers could be tests. But earlier they said \"markers/biomarkers\". But the context uses \"biomarker\" for Aβ and tau. But the list includes tests. The user wants to know if these are recognized markers. The context indicates MMSE is used for assessing severity, but not necessarily a biomarker. But it's a recognized tool for AD assessment. So maybe valid: true. Acronym: \"MMSE\".\n\nHowever, the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate... 'valid': false, 'acronym': 'N/A'\". So we need to decide.\n\nLet's examine the context: There's a table listing various measures including MMSE. It has columns: Measure name, Type of COAa, Disease severity, Total frequency, Preclinical AD, MCI, Mild AD, Moderate AD, Severe AD, Other severity/Type not listed. For MMSE, there are numbers: 4, 4, 4, 4, 3. That seems to show its usage across severities. So it's used as a measure. But is it a marker? The context says \"The MMSE is commonly used for inclusion criteria in AD clinical trials.\" That implies it's a recognized measure for AD.

We need to evaluate each element in the list:\n\nList: [\"ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living\", 'vMRI hippocampal volume: Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging hippocampal volume']\n\nWe need to check if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly rely on the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst item: \"ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living\". The context includes many references to ADCS-ADL as a measure. It appears in the tables and lists. It's described as \"Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory\" etc. Is it considered a marker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's.\" Usually ADCS-ADL is a functional outcome measure, not a biomarker. But the context might treat it as a measurement endpoint. The instruction says \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's.\" The context indicates ADCS-ADL is a measure used in trials, but it's not a biological marker. However, the user may consider it as a marker. The context states \"ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory\" and \"ADCS-ADL-PI\" etc. It is listed among endpoints. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents mention ADCS-ADL as a measure used in trials, but not necessarily a biomarker. The definition of marker: could include clinical scales? The context uses \"biomarker/imaging endpoints are not included in this table.\" So ADCS-ADL is not a biomarker. It's a clinical outcome measure. So likely not a recognized marker. But maybe the user expects it to be considered a marker because it's a measure of AD. But the instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" ADCS-ADL is correlated with AD severity. But is it a marker? It's a functional assessment tool. Might still be considered a marker. But the context explicitly says \"biomarker/imaging endpoints are not included in this table.\" That suggests ADCS-ADL is not a biomarker. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nSecond item: 'vMRI hippocampal volume: Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging hippocampal volume'. The context contains multiple sections describing volumetric MRI hippocampal volume as a biomarker. It mentions hippocampal atrophy, reduction, used in trials, etc. So yes, it's a recognized marker. Acronym: vMRI hippocampal volume? The document uses \"vMRI hippocampal volume\" as the term. Also \"volumetric MRI hippocampal volume\". The abbreviation might be \"vMRI\" or \"hippocampal volume\" alone. The context shows \"vMRI hippocampal volume: Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging hippocampal volume\". So the acronym is \"vMRI\". Or \"vMRI hippocampal volume\"? The instruction: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For hippocampal volume, the abbreviation used is \"vMRI\". So we will output \"vMRI\".\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nBut we need to follow required response format: For each element, use JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"...\",\n  \"valid\": true/false,\n  \"acronym\": \"...\"\n}\n\nSo produce array? The instruction didn't specify array but \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" So we can output a JSON array of objects. Or separate lines? Probably array.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"vMRI hippocampal volume: Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging hippocampal volume\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"vMRI\"}\n]\n\nCheck if any nuance: The first one: acronym maybe \"ADCS-ADL\". But since it's not a marker, we put N/A. The second: \"vMRI\". Good.\n\nReturn JSON.",

They ask to analyze two items: ['EQ-5D Proxy VAS: EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health-Related Quality of Life Scale Proxy Visual Analog Scale', 'RUD-Lite: Resource Utilization in Dementia-Lite'].\n\nThey want to determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and give the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info in the context. Let's examine context.\n\nFrom earlier parts: There's mention of \"EQ-5D Proxy VAS: EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health-Related Quality of Life Scale Proxy Visual Analog Scale\" appears in the first paragraph: \"Context for EQ-5D Proxy VAS: EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health-Related Quality of Life Scale Proxy Visual Analog Scale: ivities of Daily Living; CDR-SB, Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes; CFI, Cognitive Function Instrument;...\"\n\nBut we need to see if it's recognized as a marker for Alzheimer's. The document lists it among \"individual endpoints summarized\" and \"selected COAs/endpoints\". It's listed as a measurement tool used in AD clinical trials. But is it a biomarker? The question says \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". Usually biomarkers are biological measures like CSF amyloid beta, etc. However, the context includes both clinical outcome assessments (COAs) and fluid-based/imaging biomarkers. The list includes \"EQ-5D-5L\" as a proxy-rated outcome measure used across many diseases to measure immediate health. It is not a biomarker per se, but a PRO. The question might consider it as a marker? The instruction: \"Your task is to analyze a list of potential markers extracted from datasets and validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" So they treat these as potential markers. For each element, determine if it is actually a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's. So we need to check if the documents support that it is a recognized marker. The context indicates that EQ-5D-5L is used as a proxy-rated outcome measure in AD clinical trials. That suggests it's recognized as an outcome measure, but not necessarily a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents show it's used as an endpoint in AD clinical trials. That qualifies as a recognized marker? Possibly yes. But the term \"marker\" could refer to any measurable indicator. The context uses \"markers\" loosely maybe. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The context includes \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers\" section listing CSF amyloid beta, tau, etc. But also includes \"Individual biomarkers summarized\" and then lists \"CSF – amyloid beta (Aβ), CSF – tau, CSF – amyloid beta and tau ratios, Amyloid PET, Tau PET, Volumetric MRI\". Those are clearly biomarkers. The other measures are COAs. The question likely expects that EQ-5D Proxy VAS is not a biomarker but a PRO. So maybe it's not a recognized marker. But the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {original_name:..., valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\"}\".\n\nThus we need to decide validity. Based on context, EQ-5D Proxy VAS is used as an outcome measure in AD trials. Is that considered a marker? The context says \"Individual endpoints summarized\" and lists it. It doesn't say it's a biomarker. So I'd lean that it's not a biomarker. But the question might accept it as a marker because it's used as an endpoint. But the phrase \"recognised marker for Alzheimer's\" implies a biomarker. The context explicitly distinguishes between \"fluid-based and imaging biomarkers\" and \"COAs/endpoints\". So I think we should mark EQ-5D Proxy VAS as not a biomarker. Similarly, RUD-Lite: Resource Utilization in Dementia-Lite is also a PRO/outcome measure, not a biomarker. So both would be invalid markers.\n\nHowever, the user might expect that these are recognized markers because they appear in the list of endpoints. But the instruction says \"based strictly on the information provided in the context\". The context shows that RUD-Lite is listed as an individual endpoint summary. It is not described as a biomarker. So we can interpret that it's not a biomarker. So set valid=false for both.\n\nNow acronyms: For EQ-5D Proxy VAS, the acronym given is \"EQ-5D-5L\"? Wait, the text says \"EQ-5D Proxy VAS: EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health-Related Quality of Life Scale Proxy Visual Analog Scale\". The abbreviation used elsewhere is \"EQ-5D-5L\" for the 5-level version. But the specific \"Proxy VAS\" might not have a separate acronym. The context mentions \"EQ-5D-5L\" as a proxy-rated outcome measure. The \"Proxy VAS\" is part of that. The acronym might be \"EQ-5D-5L\" or \"EQ-5D Proxy VAS\". But the instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For EQ-5D Proxy VAS, the acronym used in the document is \"EQ-5D-5L\" when referring to the 5-level version. But the specific \"Proxy VAS\" might not have its own acronym. The context at top: \"Context for EQ-5D Proxy VAS: EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health-Related Quality of Life Scale Proxy Visual Analog Scale\". Then later: \"5-Level EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D-5L)\" is referenced. So the acronym is \"EQ-5D-5L\". So we can put that.\n\nFor RUD-Lite: The acronym is \"RUD-Lite\". That's already the same. So we can put \"RUD-Lite\".\n\nBut since we mark them as invalid, the acronym field should be \"N/A\" per instruction. Actually instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {original_name:..., valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\"}\". So we don't need to provide acronym even though we know it.

The instruction says: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The Mini-Zarit Inventory is a caregiver burden instrument, not a biological marker. But it's a measure used in AD studies. However, the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The Mini-Zarit Inventory is not a biomarker.

The instruction says: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The Mini-Zarit Inventory is a caregiver burden instrument, not a biological marker. But it's a measure used in AD studies. However, the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The Mini-Zarit Inventory is not a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut maybe the context includes \"Mini-Zarit Inventory\" as part of a list of COAs. The user wants to validate if it's a recognized marker. According to the documents, it's a measure used in AD, but not necessarily a biomarker. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The Mini-Zarit Inventory is used in AD studies, but it's not a biomarker. So I'd say invalid.\n\nNow second: 'CGI-C: Clinical Global Impression of Change'. The document mentions \"Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI)\" and also \"ADCS-CGIC\" and \"PGIC Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C)\". There's also \"CGI-C: Clinical Global Impression of Change\" in the list. The document references \"Clinical Global Impression of Change\" as a measure. Is it considered a marker? It's a clinician-rated global impression scale. Not a biomarker either. But again, the instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The CGI is used in AD trials, but it's not a biomarker. So probably invalid too.\n\nHowever, the user might expect that both are considered markers because they are used as outcome measures. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The context includes \"COA\" types: ClinRO, ObsRO, PRO, PerfO. These are outcome assessments, not biomarkers. The user specifically asks: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\"\n\nThus we should check if the documents provide evidence that these are recognized markers. For Mini-Zarit Inventory: The context shows it is a measure used in AD, but no mention of being a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nFor CGI-C: The context shows \"Clinical Global Impression of Change\" is referenced, but again not a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nBut perhaps the user expects that these are recognized markers because they are used in AD studies. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". So I think we should mark both as invalid.\n\nAlso we need to provide acronym. For Mini-Zarit Inventory: The acronym could be \"Mini-Zarit\". But since it's invalid, we put \"N/A\".\n\nFor CGI-C: The acronym is \"CGI-C\" itself. But if invalid, \"N/A\".\n\nWait: The instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\"\n\nSo we don't give acronym for invalid ones. So both will have acronym \"N/A\".\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects.\n\nLet's produce:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"Mini-Zarit Inventory: Mini-Zarit Inventory\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"CGI-C: Clinical Global Impression of Change\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines.

Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, we see many references to TE4D: \"Context for TE4D: Test for the Early Detection of Dementia With Discrimination From Depression: Type not listed\" etc. It appears TE4D is a measure type? But is it a marker? It's a test for early detection of dementia with discrimination from depression. Is it considered a marker? The context lists various tests like Digit Symbol, FCSRT, etc. TE4D seems to be a test. But is it a recognized marker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\".

However, the context might treat it as a measure used in clinical trials. But the instruction says: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate...\".

For each, we need to determine if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. Output JSON objects per element.\n\nWe must check if these items are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, DAD: Disability Assessment in Dementia. The document mentions DAD as a clinical and functional observer-reported outcome measure used to assess ability to perform activities, tasks, and behaviors of everyday life in people with dementia. It says \"The DAD is a clinical and functional observer-reported outcome measure\". It's not a biomarker but a functional assessment tool. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" - do they consider DAD a marker? The context says it's a measure used in dementia, but not necessarily a biomarker. However, the user might consider it a marker because it's used in clinical trials. But the instruction: \"marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" DAD is used in dementia, but is it considered a biomarker? Usually biomarkers are biological molecules, imaging, etc. DAD is a functional assessment instrument. So likely not a biomarker. But maybe the documents mention DAD as a marker? Let's search context: There's mention of DAD in the first paragraph: \"Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) The DAD is a clinical and functional observer-reported outcome measure used to assess the ability to perform activities, tasks, and behaviors of everyday life in people with dementia.\" No mention of being a biomarker. So probably not a recognized marker. So valid = false.\n\nSecond, APAS-CarB: Assessment of Subject Accommodation Status and Caregiver Burden. The context: \"Assessment of Subject Accommodation Status and Caregiver Burden: Type not listed\" appears in table. It seems like a measure name. But again, not a biomarker. The context also mentions \"pTau-217\" technology developed by Washington University, licensed to C2N Diagnostics. That is a biomarker. But APAS-CarB itself is a measure name. The context doesn't say it's a biomarker. So likely not recognized marker. So valid = false.\n\nBut we need to confirm if there is any mention of APAS-CarB as a marker. Search context: \"APAS-CarB: Assessment of Subject Accommodation Status and Caregiver Burden\" appears in the table. It lists \"Type of COAa\" maybe \"Clinical Outcome Assessment\"? It shows \"Type of COAa\" column. It has \"Type not listed\". So it's a type of measure. Not a biomarker. So not a recognized marker.\n\nThus both are invalid. Provide acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nHowever, the user wants \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For DAD, the abbreviation is DAD itself. For APAS-CarB, the abbreviation is APAS-CarB. But since they're not recognized markers, we still need to output \"acronym\": \"N/A\". Wait, the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\"\n\nSo we don't give the abbreviation even though it's present.

    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want us to analyze the list ['DAD: Disability Assessment in Dementia', 'APAS-CarB: Assessment of Subject Accommodation Status and Caregiver Burden'] based strictly on the provided documents. For each, we need to determine if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. Output JSON objects per element.\n\nWe must check if these items are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, DAD: Disability Assessment in Dementia. The document mentions DAD as a clinical and functional observer-reported outcome measure used to assess ability to perform activities, tasks, and behaviors of everyday life in people with dementia. It says \"The DAD is a clinical and functional observer-reported outcome measure\". It's not a biomarker but a functional assessment tool. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" - do they consider DAD a marker? The context says it's a measure used in dementia, but not necessarily a biomarker. However, the user might consider it a marker because it's used in clinical trials. But the instruction: \"marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" DAD is used in dementia, but is it considered a biomarker? Usually biomarkers are biological molecules, imaging, etc. DAD is a functional assessment instrument. So likely not a biomarker. But maybe the documents mention DAD as a marker? Let's search context: There's mention of DAD in the first paragraph: \"Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) The DAD is a clinical and functional observer-reported outcome measure used to assess the ability to perform activities, tasks, and behaviors of everyday life in people with dementia.\" No mention of being a biomarker. So probably not a recognized marker. So valid = false.\n\nSecond, APAS-CarB: Assessment of Subject Accommodation Status and Caregiver Burden. The context: \"Assessment of Subject Accommodation Status and Caregiver Burden: Type not listed\" appears in table. It seems like a measure name. But again, not a biomarker. The context also mentions \"pTau-217\" technology developed by Washington University, licensed to C2N Diagnostics. That is a biomarker. But APAS-CarB itself is a measure name. The context doesn't say it's a biomarker. So likely not recognized marker. So valid = false.\n\nBut we need to confirm if there is any mention of APAS-CarB as a marker. Search context: \"APAS-CarB: Assessment of Subject Accommodation Status and Caregiver Burden\" appears in the table. It lists \"Type of COAa\" maybe \"Clinical Outcome Assessment\"? It shows \"Type of COAa\" column. It has \"Type not listed\". So it's a type of measure. Not a biomarker. So not a recognized marker.\n\nThus both are invalid. Provide acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nHowever, the user wants \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For DAD, the abbreviation is DAD itself. For APAS-CarB, the abbreviation is APAS-CarB. But since they're not recognized markers, we still need to output \"acronym\": \"N/A\". Wait, the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\"\n\nSo we don't give the abbreviation even though it's present. We just put N/A.\n\nThus output should be array of two JSON objects.\n\nLet's produce:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"DAD: Disability Assessment in Dementia\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"APAS-CarB: Assessment of Subject Accommodation Status and Caregiver Burden\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines.

Use only info in the context. Provide JSON per element: original_name, valid true/false, acronym.\n\nWe need to find if the document mentions these items as markers. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, APOE4: Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele. The context includes many references to APOE, APOE ε4, etc. It says APOE ε4 carriage is a risk factor for developing late-onset AD. So yes, it's a recognized marker. Acronym? The abbreviation used in the documents: APOE, but specifically APOE ε4. But they ask for the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. The document uses \"APOE\" as abbreviation for Apolipoprotein E. Also uses \"ε4\". But the marker name is \"APOE4: Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele\". The acronym likely \"APOE\" or \"APOE ε4\". Which one is most used? The document uses \"APOE\" frequently. It also uses \"ε4\" as shorthand. But the marker itself is \"APOE4\". I'd say acronym \"APOE\".\n\nSecond, CAVGSS: Average concentration steady state. The context includes mention of \"Average concentration steady state: ce not being affected...\" etc. It's about a concept maybe not a biomarker. The context doesn't mention it as a marker for Alzheimer's. It seems like a term used in a different context. There's no mention that CAVGSS is a recognized marker. So we should mark it invalid.\n\nBut we need to provide acronym for invalid as \"N/A\".\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"APOE4: Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"APOE\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"CAVGSS: Average concentration steady state\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nMake sure JSON array?

It says \"BUN/Creatinine Ratio: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". Also \"BUN/Creatinine Ratio: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". And \"BUN/Creatinine Ratio: ance as evidence evolves.\" But does it say BUN/Creatinine Ratio is a recognized marker for AD? The context suggests it's part of biomarker profiles, but not specifically validated. The text doesn't explicitly state that BUN/Creatinine Ratio is a recognized marker for AD. It might be used in combination. But the instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So we need to see if there's enough evidence that BUN/Creatinine Ratio is a recognized marker. The context mentions \"Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\" - but that's generic. No direct statement that BUN/Creatinine Ratio itself is a marker. So probably invalid too.\n\nThus both are invalid. Acronym: For ASAT, the acronym is ASAT. For BUN_CR_RATIO, acronym is BUN/Cr ratio or BUN/Creatinine Ratio. But since invalid, acronym is \"N/A\".\n\nReturn JSON array with objects.\n\nCheck required format: For each element, use JSON structure: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false,\"acronym\":\"ACR\"}.\n\nSo produce array of two objects.\n\nLet's craft output.",

Then some repeated content. No mention of sodium as a biomarker. So likely both are not recognized markers per documents.\n\nBut we should check if there is any mention of potassium or sodium as biomarkers. Search within context: \"potassium\" appears only in those headings. \"sodium\" appears only in headings. No mention of their role.\n\nThus both are invalid markers.\n\nNow acronyms: Since invalid, acronym = \"N/A\".\n\nReturn JSON array with objects.\n\nLet's produce output accordingly.",

    "biomarker": {
      "original_name": "TBIL: Total Bilirubin",
      "valid": false,
      "acronym": "N/A"
    },
    "cot": "We need to parse the context. We have a long excerpt from documents. The user wants to validate two items: 'TBIL: Total Bilirubin' and 'TG: Triglycerides'. They want to know if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly rely only on the provided context. Let's examine the context for TBIL: There is mention of \"Total Bilirubin\" and \"TBIL\". It says \"Context for TBIL: Total Bilirubin: ance as evidence evolves.\" There's some text about emerging paradigms, biomarker combinations, etc. But we need to check whether TBIL is recognized as a marker for Alzheimer's in these documents. The context includes references to blood-based biomarkers, but doesn't explicitly say TBIL is a marker. It might be part of a broader discussion of blood-based biomarkers. But we need to see if there's explicit mention that TBIL is a marker. The snippet: \"Context for TBIL: Total Bilirubin: ance as evidence evolves. Clinicians are encouraged to stay informed about emerging paradigms—such as biomarker combinations or ratios and multi-threshold testing—that may further refine the diagnostic accuracy of BBMs as the field evolves.\" That seems generic. No direct claim that TBIL is a marker. So likely it's not validated.\n\nBut maybe earlier there is mention: \"Total Bilirubin: ance as evidence evolves.\" Not sure. The phrase \"ence\" truncated? Might be \"Evidence\"? Hard to tell. But no explicit mention of TBIL being a marker.\n\nThus we would mark TBIL as invalid.\n\nNow TG: Triglycerides. The context mentions triglycerides in relation to Alzheimer's. For example: \"Context for TG: Triglycerides: res the awardee to share...\" Also \"Context for TG: Triglycerides: The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease 12 (2025) 100056...\". And \"Context for TG: Triglycerides: trials were enriched with Centiloid Aβ PET levels...\". Also \"Context for TG: Triglycerides: erging pathology in Alzheimer’s disease.\" So TG appears to be discussed as a biomarker. But is it recognized as a marker? The context indicates that triglycerides are considered in studies, perhaps as a risk factor or biomarker. But do the documents state that TG is a recognized marker? The context includes \"triglycerides\" but not necessarily stating it's a marker. However, the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context includes mention of TG in relation to Alzheimer's, but not necessarily that it's a recognized marker. But the context includes \"triglycerides\" in the title of a paper: \"Trigon...\". Actually the snippet: \"Context for TG: Triglycerides: The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease 12 (2025) 100056 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/tjpad Review Cutting through the noise: A narrative review of Alzheimer’s disease plasma biomarkers for routine clinical use M.

Palmqvist m, n, * a Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry...\"\n\nSo the review is about plasma biomarkers for routine clinical use. It likely includes TG as one of them. But the context doesn't explicitly say TG is a recognized marker. But given the context, it seems TG is considered as a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention TG in the context of Alzheimer's, but not necessarily that it's a recognized marker. However, the context includes \"triglycerides\" as part of a review of plasma biomarkers. That suggests it's considered a biomarker. So we can treat TG as a recognized marker.\n\nAlso we need to provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For TBIL, the abbreviation is TBIL. For TG, the abbreviation is TG. But the question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For TBIL: TBIL. For TG: TG. But maybe the document uses \"TG\" as abbreviation. Yes.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"TBIL: Total Bilirubin\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"TG: Triglycerides\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"TG\"}\n]\n\nBut ensure JSON format exactly as required: Each object separate lines? They didn't specify array or separate objects. They said \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" then give examples. Likely produce an array of objects. We'll produce array.\n\nLet's craft final answer.",

    "cot": "We need to parse the context. We have two items: 'UREA_BUN: Urea/BUN' and 'NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory'.\n\nWe need to check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention Urea/BUN as part of biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, etc. It says \"Urea/BUN: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". So Urea/BUN appears as a biomarker? But is it recognized as a marker? The text seems to discuss biomarker profiles including Urea/BUN. It's likely considered a biomarker but maybe not validated. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The document mentions Urea/BUN as part of biomarker profiles. That suggests it's considered a marker. There's also mention of \"Urea/BUN: vice\" etc. So we can say valid = true. Acronym: The abbreviation given is UREA_BUN: Urea/BUN. The acronym might just be UREA_BUN or Urea/BUN. They want the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For Urea/BUN, the abbreviation is UREA_BUN. So output: original_name: 'UREA_BUN: Urea/BUN', valid:true, acronym:'UREA_BUN'.\n\nNow NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory. The context includes many references to NPI as a measure. It is listed under \"Measure name\" table. It is a type of outcome measure. Is it a marker? It's a behavioral inventory, not a biological marker. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The NPI is a neuropsychiatric inventory used as an outcome measure, not necessarily a biomarker. The context shows it as a measure used in clinical trials. But is it considered a marker? The instruction: \"marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The NPI is a tool measuring neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with AD, but it's not a biomarker per se. The context doesn't explicitly state that NPI is a biomarker. It lists it among measures. So probably not a recognized biomarker. So valid=false, acronym='NPI'? But they ask for acronym if valid else N/A. So we put acronym:\"N/A\".\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines? They didn't specify array but likely array. Use JSON array.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"UREA_BUN: Urea/BUN\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"UREA_BUN\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nReturn that.",

    "biomarker": {
      "original_name": "CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression-Improvement",
      "valid": false,
      "acronym": "N/A"
    },
    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want us to analyze two items: 'CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression-Improvement' and 'Florbetaben: tracer used in PET scans to detect amyloid plaques'. We must determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use info from the provided context. Let's review the context.\n\nFirst, there is mention of \"CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression-Improvement\" in multiple places. For example, at top: \"Context for CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression-Improvement: Type not listed\". Then later: \"Context for CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression-Improvement: is is the experience and thoughts of our expert authors\". And again: \"Context for CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression-Improvement: Citation: Gunes, S.;...\". So CGI-I appears as a measure type. It seems to be a clinical rating scale used in trials. But is it considered a biomarker? The document says \"CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression-Improvement\" is a measure. It's a ClinRO (clinician-reported outcome). The question: Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? According to the documents, it's a clinical global impression improvement scale, used as an endpoint. It might be considered a clinical outcome measure, not a biomarker per se. However, the user asks: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents refer to it as a measure used in trials, but not explicitly as a biomarker. The definition of biomarker includes biological measures like CSF proteins, imaging etc. The CGI-I is a clinician-rated scale, not a biological marker. So likely we should say it's not a recognized biomarker. But maybe they consider it a marker? The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The documents mention CGI-I as a measure used in trials, but not specifically as a biomarker. So I'd mark it as invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression-Improvement\" as part of Table 1. It lists \"CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression-Improvement\" under \"Type of COAa\" maybe. It says \"CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression-Improvement: Type not listed\". That suggests it's a measure but not a biomarker. There's no mention of correlation with Alzheimer's. So invalid.\n\nNow second item: \"Florbetaben: tracer used in PET scans to detect amyloid plaques\". The context definitely mentions Florbetaben as a tracer used in PET scans to detect amyloid plaques. It states \"Florbetaben: tracer used in PET scans to detect amyloid plaques: ful accuracy.\" Also \"Florbetaben: tracer used in PET scans to detect amyloid plaques: rkers such as Aβ42, total Tau (tTau), phosphorylated Tau (pTau), Aβ42:40 ratio, and pTau:Aβ42 ratio are quantitative.\" So yes, Florbetaben is a biomarker/tracer used in PET imaging. So it's a recognized marker. Acronym: The abbreviation given is \"Florbetaben\" itself? Usually the tracer is referred to as \"Florbetaben\" or \"Neuraceq™\". But the context uses \"Florbetaben\" as the name. The acronym may be \"FB\"? Not sure. The context doesn't give an acronym. It just says \"Florbetaben: tracer used in PET scans to detect amyloid plaques\". No acronym. But maybe the abbreviation is \"Florbetaben\" itself. The instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For Florbetaben, I don't see an acronym. Maybe \"Florbetaben\" is the name, no acronym. Could be \"FBB\"? But not in text. So we might set acronym to \"N/A\" or maybe \"Florbetaben\" itself. But the instruction says if not a valid marker, acronym N/A. But here it's valid, so we need an acronym. Since none is given, perhaps we can use \"Florbetaben\" as the acronym? But that's not an abbreviation. The instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" If none, maybe we still put \"N/A\"? But that conflicts with valid. But maybe we can interpret that if no acronym is mentioned, we can put \"N/A\". But the instruction says \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { 'original_name':..., 'valid': false, 'acronym': 'N/A'}\". It doesn't specify what to do if valid but no acronym. But we can still put \"N/A\" if no acronym exists. But maybe we should find an acronym. The context mentions \"PET\", \"SPECT\", \"MRI\", \"FDG-PET\", \"fMRI\", \"Tau-PET\", \"Amyloid PET\". But not specific to Florbetaben. The context also mentions \"Flortaucipir [TauvidTM]\" as a tracer. But not acronym. So likely no acronym. So we can put \"N/A\".\n\nHowever, the user expects a JSON array with objects for each element. Each object must contain original_name, valid, acronym. So produce two objects.\n\nThus:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression-Improvement\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"Florbetaben: tracer used in PET scans to detect amyloid plaques\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nBut maybe we can use \"Florbetaben\" as acronym? But it's same as full name. Might be okay. But I'll keep \"N/A\" to be safe.\n\nDouble-check: Are there any references to \"CGI-I\" as a biomarker? The context says \"CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression-Improvement: Type not listed\". It is a ClinRO. So not a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nThus final answer.",

In the context, we see mention of EQ-5D-5L, which is a proxy-rated outcome measure used across many diseases to measure immediate health.

Is it considered a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? It's a quality-of-life measure, not a biomarker. But the question says \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The document lists it among \"selected COAs/endpoints\" and mentions it's used in AD clinical trials. So yes, it's a recognized outcome assessment instrument used in AD studies. So we can say valid: true. Acronym: \"EQ-5D-5L\"? Wait the full name is \"EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health-Related Quality of Life Scale Proxy Visual Analog Scale\". The abbreviation used in the document: \"EQ-5D Proxy VAS\" maybe.

But the item itself is \"EQ-5D Proxy VAS: EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health-Related Quality of Life Scale Proxy Visual Analog Scale\". So likely the acronym is \"EQ-5D Proxy VAS\". But maybe they'd accept \"EQ-5D-5L\" as the standard abbreviation. But the item specifically includes \"Proxy VAS\", so I'd use \"EQ-5D Proxy VAS\".\n\nSecond item: \"LY450139 CL: Clearance of LY450139\". This seems like a drug clearance study, not a biomarker. The context mentions \"LY450139 CL: Clearance of LY450139\" in the context for \"Clearance of LY450139:...\" referencing a technology for measuring pTau-217. That is a biomarker assay. But the item \"LY450139 CL: Clearance of LY450139\" is not a marker; it's a pharmacokinetic parameter. There's no mention that it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The context indicates that the technology for measuring pTau-217 was developed, but the item itself is not a marker. So we should mark it as invalid: false, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nBut careful: The required output format: For each element, use JSON structure: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"...\"}.\n\nProbably output as a list of those objects. The system instructions: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" then shows object. So we should output an array of objects.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"EQ-5D Proxy VAS: EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health-Related Quality of Life Scale Proxy Visual Analog Scale\",\n    \"valid\": true,\n    \"acronym\": \"EQ-5D Proxy VAS\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"LY450139 CL: Clearance of LY450139\",\n    \"valid\": false,\n    \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nCheck if any nuance: The second item might be considered a marker? The context: \"Technology for measurement of pTau-217\" is a biomarker. But the item is \"LY450139 CL: Clearance of LY450139\". That is not a biomarker.

There is extensive discussion of plasma amyloid beta 1-42 as a biomarker. Yes recognized. Acronym: Aβ1-42? But we need the most known abbreviation. In documents, it's referred to as \"Aβ1-42\", \"Abeta42\". The acronym could be \"Aβ1‑42\" or \"Abeta42\". They ask for acronym/abbreviation. Probably \"Aβ1‑42\" or \"Abeta42\".

We need to check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info from the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nThe context contains many references to MMSE, including description, usage, etc. It says: \"The MMSE is a performance outcome that quantitatively assesses the severity of cognitive impairment.\" It's used for inclusion criteria in AD clinical trials. So it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The acronym is MMSE. The document uses \"Mini Mental State Examination\" and abbreviation \"MMSE\". So we should set valid:true, acronym:\"MMSE\".\n\nNow for QoL-AD: The context describes \"Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QoL-AD)\" as a measure assessing quality of life. It is used in clinical trials. It is a PRO (patient-reported outcome). Is it a biomarker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" – In the context, QoL-AD is described as a measurement tool, not necessarily a biomarker. But the instruction: \"Your task is to analyze a list of potential markers extracted from datasets and validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" And \"For each element in the list, you must: VALIDATION: Determine if the element is actually a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". So we need to see if QoL-AD qualifies as a recognized marker/biomarker. The context indicates it's a quality of life measure, not a biological marker. However, the question might consider it as a marker because it's used as an endpoint. But the definition of biomarker is usually a measurable indicator of a biological process. QoL-AD is a patient-reported outcome, not a biomarker. The context doesn't say it's a biomarker. So likely it's not a recognized biomarker. But maybe the user expects it to be considered a marker because it's listed among endpoints. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The context says \"QoL-AD assesses quality of life...\". There's no mention of it being a biomarker. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context mentions \"Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QoL-AD)... The QoL-AD assesses quality of life, physical condition, mood, interpersonal relationships, ability to participate in meaningful activity, and financial situation.\" It also says \"Both self-assessment and informant interview versions exist; each can be completed in under 10 minutes.\" It doesn't call it a biomarker.

Use JSON format: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"...\"}.\n\nWe must strictly rely only on the provided documents. So we need to see whether each appears as a marker. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst item: 'RUD-Lite: Resource Utilization in Dementia-Lite'. In the document, there is mention of \"Resource Utilization in Dementia-Lite Version (RUD-Lite)\" multiple times. It seems like it's an endpoint measure used in dementia trials. Is it a biomarker? It's a resource utilization measure, not a biomarker. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" According to the documents. The documents talk about fluid-based and imaging biomarkers, but also mention many clinical outcome measures. Are those considered markers? Usually biomarkers are biological indicators. RUD-Lite is a resource utilization measure, not a biomarker. The context says \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in AD clinical trials\". But RUD-Lite is listed under \"Endpoints in AD clinical trials\" earlier. It might be considered an outcome measure rather than a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" I think RUD-Lite is not a biomarker. So valid = false. Acronym: \"RUD-Lite\" maybe. But if invalid, acronym should be \"N/A\".\n\nSecond item: 'Plaque Imaging: Amyloid plaque brain scan'. The context includes \"Plaque Imaging: Amyloid plaque brain scan\" as part of the list. There is mention of amyloid PET, etc. The phrase \"Plaque Imaging: Amyloid plaque brain scan\" appears in the context. It refers to imaging of amyloid plaques. That is indeed a biomarker: amyloid PET imaging. The acronym could be \"Aβ-PET\" or \"Amyloid PET\". The context uses \"Amyloid PET\" as a biomarker. Also \"PET\" stands for Positron Emission Tomography. The phrase \"Plaque Imaging: Amyloid plaque brain scan\" may refer to \"Amyloid PET\". So we can say valid=true, acronym=\"Amyloid PET\" or \"Aβ-PET\". Which is most used abbreviation? In the context, they mention \"Amyloid PET\" explicitly. So acronym: \"Amyloid PET\". Or maybe \"Aβ-PET\". The context uses \"Amyloid PET\" as a biomarker. So we choose \"Amyloid PET\".\n\nBut we need to check if the phrase \"Plaque Imaging: Amyloid plaque brain scan\" is itself a marker. The context lists \"Plaque Imaging: Amyloid plaque brain scan\" as a heading. Under \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in AD clinical trials\", they list \"CSF – amyloid beta (Aβ), CSF – tau, CSF – amyloid beta and tau ratios, Amyloid PET, Tau PET, Volumetric MRI\". So yes, amyloid PET is a biomarker. So valid=true.\n\nNow produce JSON array? The instruction: For each element, use this JSON structure. Probably output an array of objects. The example: For each element, use this JSON structure. So we output something like:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"...\",\n    \"valid\":...,\n    \"acronym\":...\n  },\n ...\n]\n\nLet's do that.\n\nCheck first item: original_name: 'RUD-Lite: Resource Utilization in Dementia-Lite'. Acronym: \"RUD-Lite\". But since invalid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nSecond item: original_name: 'Plaque Imaging: Amyloid plaque brain scan'. Acronym: \"Amyloid PET\".\n\nDouble-check if there's any mention of \"Plaque Imaging: Amyloid plaque brain scan\" as a specific acronym. The context shows \"Plaque Imaging: Amyloid plaque brain scan\" as a heading. But no acronym given. However, within the same section, they mention \"Amyloid PET\". So that's likely the acronym. So we will use \"Amyloid PET\".\n\nThus final JSON array.\n\nMake sure to follow required format exactly: Each object with keys: original_name, valid, acronym. No extra keys. Output as JSON array. Ensure proper quoting.",

The list contains two items: ['CogState: Composite Score', \"ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\"].\n\nWe need to check if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. We should look at the context. There is mention of \"CogState: Composite Score\" in the first part of the document: \"Context for CogState: Composite Score: Type not listed\". It seems like it's a composite score used in some tests. But we need to see if it's recognized as a marker. The context shows that CogState: Composite Score is a type of measure, maybe a performance outcome. It's listed under \"Measure name\" in Table 1? Actually Table 1 lists many outcome measures, but I'm not sure if CogState: Composite Score is there. Let's search the text: There's \"Context for CogState: Composite Score: Type not listed\". That suggests that CogState: Composite Score is a measure but perhaps not specifically a biomarker. The question: Are these considered markers? The context includes many cognitive tests and scales. The question says \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So we need to decide if CogState: Composite Score is recognized as a marker. The context indicates it's a composite score used in cognitive testing. It might be considered a performance outcome rather than a biomarker. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. According to the documents, there's no explicit statement that CogState: Composite Score is a biomarker. It is just a composite score used in cognitive assessments. The question: Is it a recognized marker? The documents mention \"CogState: Composite Score\" but do not say it's a biomarker. It may be a cognitive test measure. The user likely expects that CogState: Composite Score is not a biomarker but a cognitive test. So we would mark it as invalid. For the acronym, we can provide \"N/A\".\n\nNow for \"ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\". The documents definitely talk about ADAS-Cog extensively. It is a widely used cognitive scale. The documents mention \"ADAS-Cog-11\", \"ADAS-Cog-13\", etc. The acronym is ADAS-Cog. So it's valid.

Based strictly on the provided context, we need to decide if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe should look through the context. There are multiple references to \"Plasma Amyloid Beta 1-42\" and \"Aβ1-42\". The first item is basically the same as the second? Actually the first is the marker itself, the second is area under the curve of that marker. But the question: Is \"Area Under the Curve of Plasma Amyloid Beta 1-42\" a recognized marker? It seems it's a metric derived from biomarker measurement, not a biological marker per se. The context includes repeated mention of \"AUC-Aβ1-42\" as part of analytic validity, etc. But is it considered a marker? The context says \"Area Under the Curve of Plasma Amyloid Beta 1-42: adigm for advancing...\" It's used in research contexts. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents talk about Aβ1-42 as a biomarker. AUC is a statistical measure of diagnostic performance. So likely not considered a biomarker itself. So we might mark it as invalid.\n\nBut let's examine the context: There's repeated mention of \"AUC-Aβ1-42: Area Under the Curve of Plasma Amyloid Beta 1-42\" in the context. It appears in the heading \"Context for AUC-Aβ1-42: Area Under the Curve of Plasma Amyloid Beta 1-42\". Then there are citations referencing AUC. But is it a recognized marker? The text says \"Area Under the Curve of Plasma Amyloid Beta 1-42: adigm for advancing...\". That suggests they treat it as a concept. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents discuss Aβ1-42 as a marker. AUC is just a metric. So I'd say it's not a marker. So valid = false.\n\nNow the acronym: For the first item, the most known abbreviation is \"Aβ1-42\" or \"Aβ42\"? The document uses \"Aβ1-42\" frequently. Also \"Abeta42\" sometimes. The acronym could be \"Aβ1-42\" or \"Aβ42\". The instruction: Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker. The document uses \"Aβ1-42\" as the name.

There's mention of \"TMT: Trail Making Test\" as part of guidelines. But is it considered a biomarker? The documents talk about \"biomarkers of tauopathy\" and \"A/T/N framework\", but TMT is a cognitive test, not a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents don't present TMT as a biomarker; they discuss it as a test used in guidelines. So likely not a recognized biomarker. So valid = false. Acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nBut let's double-check: Are there any statements that TMT is a biomarker? The text: \"The Alzheimer’s Association... developed technology for the measurement of pTau-217. This technology was subsequently licensed to C2N Diagnostics.\" That is separate.

I don't see any mention that they are biomarkers. They are listed as \"Measure name\" in Table 1 and Table 2. They are cognitive tests. There's no mention of them being biomarkers. So we should mark them as invalid.\n\nBut we need to provide the acronym. For \"CubD: Cube Drawing Test\", the acronym might be \"CubD\"? Or maybe \"CDT\"? Wait, \"Clock Drawing Test\" abbreviation is CDT. But the document uses \"Clock Drawing Test (CDT)\" or \"Clock Draw Interpretation Scale (CDIS)\". For Cube Drawing Test, maybe \"CubD\"? The context shows \"CubD: Cube Drawing Test\" at top. But there is no other acronym. So we can use \"CubD\".\n\nSimilarly for Clock Drawing Test, the acronym could be \"CDT\". The context lists \"Clock Drawing Test (CDT) or Clock Draw Interpretation Scale (CDIS)\". So the most known abbreviation is \"CDT\". So we can give that.\n\nNow produce JSON array with objects for each element.\n\nFormat: Each object: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"...\"}\n\nSo for both, valid=false, acronym accordingly.\n\nLet's craft output.\n\nAlso note: The instruction says: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\"\n\nWait, earlier system instructions said: For each element, use JSON structure: { \"original_name\": \"name as provided in the list\", \"valid\": true/false, \"acronym\": \"ACR\" }. If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"name as provided\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\n\nSo we should use \"N/A\" for acronym if invalid.

We must determine if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info from the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nThere is mention of CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating. It appears multiple times. It's described as a measure used to stage AD, capturing severity. It is used as a primary endpoint in early AD RCTs. So yes, it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The acronym is CDR. But also sometimes referred to as CDR-SB (sum of boxes). The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating, the abbreviation is CDR. In the document, they refer to CDR-SB as Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes. But the main abbreviation is CDR. So we set acronym: CDR.\n\nNow GDS: Geriatric Depression Scale. Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context includes GDS but mostly about depression scale. There's no mention that GDS is a biomarker for AD. The context lists many measures including GDS but doesn't say it's a marker for AD. The user says \"based strictly on the information provided\". So we must check if GDS is recognized as a marker for AD. The context mentions GDS under \"GDS: Geriatric Depression Scale\" but no further explanation. It might be used as a measure of depression in older adults, not necessarily a biomarker for AD. The context does not state that GDS is a marker for AD. Therefore, we mark it as invalid.\n\nBut we need to confirm: Are there any references to GDS being used as a biomarker? The context shows \"GDS: Geriatric Depression Scale\" but no mention of its role. So likely invalid.\n\nThus output JSON array with objects for each element.\n\nFormat: For each element, use JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"...\",\n  \"valid\": true/false,\n  \"acronym\": \"...\"\n}\n\nSo produce two objects.\n\nLet's craft final answer accordingly.",

    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want us to analyze two items: 'FDG-PET: 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography' and 'SUV: Standardized Uptake Value'. Based strictly on the provided context, we need to determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe should check the context. There are many references about FDG-PET as a biomarker for Alzheimer's. For example, reference 23: Garibotto V, Herholz K, etc. \"Clinical validity of brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography as a biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease\". Also reference 35: Yuan, Y.; Gu, Z.X.; Wei, W.S. \"Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography...for prediction of rapid conversion to Alzheimer disease\". So FDG-PET is indeed a recognized marker. The acronym used is FDG-PET. The full name is 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography. So the acronym is FDG-PET. That matches the first item.\n\nNow for SUV: Standardized Uptake Value. Is SUV considered a marker? It's a quantitative measure used in PET imaging, but is it itself a marker? The context mentions SUV in relation to PET imaging, but it's not necessarily a biomarker per se. It says \"Standardized Uptake Value:...\". But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" Does the document mention SUV as a marker? Let's search the context. There's mention of \"SUVr\" (standardized uptake value ratio) as a metric for PET imaging. For example, \"Aβ-PET SUVr\" is used as a proxy. But SUV alone might not be a marker. The context includes \"Standardized Uptake Value:...\". But is there evidence that SUV is a recognized marker? The context seems to treat SUV as part of imaging metrics, but not necessarily a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" So we need to decide whether SUV qualifies as a recognized marker. The context indicates that SUV is used in measuring uptake in PET scans, but the marker is usually the tracer uptake pattern, like FDG-PET uptake patterns. SUV is just a numeric value. The context doesn't explicitly say SUV is a biomarker. It refers to \"Standardized Uptake Value:...\". But no explicit claim that SUV is a marker. So likely we consider it not a recognized marker. Therefore valid = false, acronym = \"N/A\".\n\nBut maybe they want to treat SUV as a marker because it's used in the context of PET imaging for Alzheimer's. But the instruction: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents mention SUV as a concept but not as a marker. So I'd mark it invalid.\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"...\"}\n\nReturn as JSON array? The system instructions said: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" then shows object. It didn't specify array, but typical would be array. We'll produce array.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n{\"original_name\":\"FDG-PET: 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"FDG-PET\"},\n{\"original_name\":\"SUV: Standardized Uptake Value\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nMake sure no extra keys.

The documents mention MRI VBM as a structural imaging biomarker. Yes, context says \"MRI VBM: MRI Voxel-Based Morphometry\" appears in references. It's a biomarker. So valid true. Acronym? They already give \"MRI VBM\". But maybe acronym is \"VBM\"? The document uses \"MRI VBM\" as term. The acronym could be \"VBM\". But question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For MRI VBM, abbreviation is \"VBM\". But the item includes \"MRI VBM:\" prefix. Might want \"VBM\". Let's choose \"VBM\".\n\nSecond: Behave-AD: Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale. Document mentions BEHAVE-AD as rating scale. So it's a behavioral assessment tool, but is it considered a biomarker? The context says \"Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale\" is a tool used to assess behavior, used as endpoint in trials. Is it a biomarker? Biomarker usually refers to measurable indicator of disease state. Behavior scales might be considered clinical outcome measures rather than biomarkers. The instruction: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The document lists BEHAVE-AD as a measurement instrument, but not necessarily a biomarker. The context says \"behavioral pathology rating scale\" used as endpoint. Not explicitly called biomarker. So probably invalid. But let's see if any mention of BEHAVE-AD being a biomarker. The text: \"Another informant-based assessment tool measuring NPS... is the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD).\" It doesn't call it a biomarker. So I think it's not a biomarker. So valid=false, acronym=\"N/A\".\n\nReturn JSON array? System says for each element use JSON structure. Probably output array of objects. We'll produce array.",

QOL-AD is a PRO (patient-reported outcome) measure, not a biological marker. However it's used as endpoint. The document lists it as an endpoint. So maybe considered a marker?

The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents mention WAIS-R FAS Verbal Fluency as a measure used to predict progression to AD. It is used as a predictor. But is it considered a marker? Possibly yes, as a cognitive marker.

The acronym could be WAIS-R FAS. But typical abbreviation is WAIS-R. But the specific test is \"FAS Verbal Fluency\". Might be abbreviated as \"FAS\". But the user expects an acronym.

I'd choose \"WAIS-R FAS\".\n\nNow decide validity: Are these recognized markers? The documents treat them as endpoints, not biomarkers. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention them as endpoints. That qualifies as a marker? The term \"marker\" might be broader. But the user specifically said \"markers/biomarkers\". The documents mention \"biomarkers\" like CSF amyloid beta & tau, PET amyloid beta & tau. QOL-AD is not a biomarker. So invalid.

The acronym could be WAIS-R FAS. But typical abbreviation is WAIS-R. But the specific test is \"FAS Verbal Fluency\". Might be abbreviated as \"FAS\". But the user expects an acronym. The context earlier lists \"WAIS-R FAS Verbal Fluency\" as a measure. There's no separate acronym given. But we can give \"WAIS-R FAS\".\n\nHowever, the instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker.\" For QOL-AD, the acronym is \"QoL-AD\". For WAIS-R FAS Verbal Fluency, the acronym might be \"WAIS-R FAS\" or simply \"WAIS-R\". But the context uses \"WAIS-R FAS Verbal Fluency\". I'd choose \"WAIS-R FAS\".\n\nNow decide validity: Are these recognized markers? The documents treat them as endpoints, not biomarkers. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention them as endpoints. That qualifies as a marker? The term \"marker\" might be broader. But the user specifically said \"markers/biomarkers\". The documents mention \"biomarkers\" like CSF amyloid beta & tau, PET amyloid beta & tau. QOL-AD is not a biomarker. So invalid. WAIS-R FAS is a cognitive test, not a biomarker either. So invalid too. But the user might consider them as markers because they are used to track disease progression. But the instruction says \"must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The documents show correlation. So maybe valid. But the phrase \"marker/biomarker\" implies biological or measurable indicator. The documents categorize them as \"COAs/endpoints\" not biomarkers. So I'd mark both as invalid.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"QOL-AD: Logsdon Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"QoL-AD\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"WAIS-R FAS Verbal Fluency: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‑Revised FAS Verbal Fluency\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"WAIS-R FAS\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separated by comma inside array.

No, it's a clinical assessment tool measuring severity of impairment. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". Usually biomarkers refer to biological markers like CSF amyloid, etc. SIB is not a biomarker; it's a clinical rating scale. The context might mention that SIB is used as a measure of disease severity. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The document lists SIB as a measure, but not necessarily a biomarker. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The context includes SIB as a measure used in clinical trials for AD. That suggests it is used as an outcome measure, not a biomarker. But the question: \"Recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" Could be ambiguous. But given the context, SIB is a measure used in AD trials, so it is recognized as a tool for assessing AD severity. But is it a marker? The definition of marker: \"Biomarker\" typically refers to biological markers. But the user didn't specify \"biomarker\" explicitly; they said \"marker\". The system instructions say: \"You are an expert in Alzheimer's markers (and biomarkers).\" So we should treat markers as biomarkers. SIB is not a biomarker. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nNow NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory. The context includes NPI as a measure used in AD trials. It is a questionnaire measuring behavioral disturbances.

The context includes tables listing measures used in studies, with types like ObsRO, ClinRO, etc. It lists CMAI as a measure. But is it a marker? It's a behavioral inventory measuring agitation. Is it considered a marker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" meaning biomarker? The CMAI is a clinical rating instrument, not a biomarker. The document says it's a measure used in studies. But the instruction: \"validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" So we look at context: Table 1 lists CMAI as a measure, type ObsRO, frequency 4, etc. It doesn't say it's a biomarker. So likely not a recognized marker. So valid = false.\n\nSecond: Florbetapir-PET: fluorbetapir PET imaging of amyloid. This is definitely a biomarker. The context mentions PET imaging of amyloid, references to Aβ PET, etc. So valid = true. Acronym: Aβ-PET? They mention \"Aβ-PET\" or \"Aβ-PET\". Also \"Aβ-PET\" abbreviation appears.

We must determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info from the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst item: 'APD: Amyloid plaque density (post-mortem immunohistochemistry)'. The context includes mention of APD: Amyloid plaque density (post-mortem immunohistochemistry). It says: \"Context for APD: Amyloid plaque density (post-mortem immunohistochemistry): it has been able to distinguish abnormal from normal amyloid-positron emission tomography (A-PET) scans...\" etc. So APD is indeed a marker. It's used as a measure of amyloid plaque density. The document refers to it as a marker. So it's valid. Acronym: APD. But we might consider that the abbreviation is APD. The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For APD, the abbreviation is APD. So we output:\n\n{\n\"original_name\":\"APD: Amyloid plaque density (post-mortem immunohistochemistry)\",\n\"valid\":true,\n\"acronym\":\"APD\"\n}\n\nSecond item: 'COWAT: Controlled Oral Word Association Test'. The context includes many references to COWAT. It appears in tables describing measures. It is described as a test, but is it a marker? The context indicates that COWAT is a neuropsychological test used to assess cognitive function, and is used in clinical trials and research. Is it a biomarker? The instruction: \"determine if it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context says COWAT is a test, not necessarily a biomarker. But the context mentions that it is used to assess cognitive function and is used in clinical trials. Does the document treat it as a marker? The earlier part of the conversation about biomarkers lists plasma biomarkers like amyloid, tau, etc. The COWAT is a cognitive test, not a biochemical marker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents refer to COWAT as a measure used in clinical trials, but not as a biomarker. The definition of marker: something that indicates disease state. COWAT is a test measuring cognitive ability, which can reflect disease progression. But is it considered a marker? The context says \"Used widely in the clinical setting... helpful in clinical trials and for patient outcomes.\" It doesn't explicitly say it's a biomarker. But the user wants to know if it's a recognized marker. According to the documents, COWAT is a test, not a biomarker. So likely invalid. But maybe they consider it a marker because it's used to detect cognitive impairment. The context: \"COWAT: Controlled Oral Word Association Test\" appears in Table 1, with type PerfO (performance outcome). It is listed under \"Measure name\", \"Type of COAa\" (maybe \"clinical outcome assessment\"?). It is not labeled as a biomarker. So I'd say it's not a recognized marker. So valid=false, acronym=\"N/A\".\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"COWAT: Controlled Oral Word Association Test\" multiple times. It is described as a test used to assess cognitive function. There's no mention of it being a biomarker.

Based strictly on the provided documents, we need to decide if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must output JSON objects per element, with fields original_name, valid, acronym. For invalid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nWe must rely solely on the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nThe context includes many references to MMSE, including description, usage in clinical trials, etc. So MMSE is definitely a recognized marker for Alzheimer's in the documents. The acronym is MMSE. The document uses \"Mini Mental State Examination\" and abbreviation \"MMSE\". So it's valid.\n\nNow FCI: Financial Capacity Instrument. The context mentions FCI in some paragraphs about financial capacity instrument, but does it mention that FCI is a biomarker for Alzheimer's? The context says: \"Financial Capacity Instrument: to-decision procedures. Compliance with this methodology is essential to implement AD biomarkers efficiently in clinical research and diagnostics.\" But that's about methodology. There's also mention of \"Financial Capacity Instrument: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". Also \"Financial Capacity Instrument: curacy in detecting AD in MCI patients found exceedingly large variability of results and concluded that no clinical recommendation could be issued based on such data [17].\"\n\nSo FCI is a tool measuring financial capacity, presumably a functional measure. Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context suggests that FCI has been studied for detecting AD in MCI patients, but results had high variability and no recommendation. That indicates that FCI may not be validated as a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents say that FCI was studied but results were variable and no recommendation. Does that mean it's not recognized? The phrase \"no clinical recommendation could be issued based on such data\" implies insufficient evidence. So likely invalid.\n\nBut let's read more carefully: The context says: \"Financial Capacity Instrument: curacy in detecting AD in MCI patients found exceedingly large variability of results and concluded that no clinical recommendation could be issued based on such data [17].\" That seems to suggest that FCI is not a reliable marker. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nAlso the acronym: The document refers to \"FCI\" as abbreviation. So the acronym is FCI. But since it's invalid, we put \"N/A\".\n\nThus produce JSON array? The instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\"... So maybe output separate JSON objects one after another? Usually they'd expect an array of objects. But they didn't specify array explicitly. They said \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {... }\". Could output multiple lines? I'd output an array of objects. But to be safe, I'll output a JSON array containing both objects.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"MMSE: Mini Mental State Examination\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"MMSE\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"FCI: Financial Capacity Instrument\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object keys exactly as required.

We must strictly use only info in the context above. So we need to see whether MRI is considered a marker for Alzheimer's in the documents. The context includes mention of MRI as a structural imaging biomarker used to predict disease progression, differentiate AD from MCI, etc. So yes, MRI is a recognized biomarker. The acronym likely is MRI itself. But maybe they want \"MRI\" as the abbreviation. For SBP: Systolic Blood Pressure. Is SBP a recognized marker? The context mentions blood-based biomarkers, but SBP is not specifically listed as a biomarker. There's mention of blood biomarkers like plasma pTau-217, etc. SBP is not a biomarker per se.

Therefore valid = false, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nBut let's double-check: Are there any statements like \"Creatine is a biomarker for Alzheimer's\"? Search the context: There's no such phrase. There's mention of \"Cr: creatine\" but no claim. So invalid.\n\nThus produce two JSON objects.\n\nNeed to follow required response format: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably output array of objects? The instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {... }\". It doesn't specify array, but typical would be separate lines? Usually they'd expect an array. But they didn't explicitly say array. Could output each JSON object separated by newline. But safer to output an array of objects. However the instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" then shows object. That implies each element individually. But we can output an array containing both objects. Many similar tasks use array. I'll output array.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"pTau: phosphorylated tau\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"pTau\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"Cr: creatine\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nMake sure no extra keys.

There is discussion about plasma biomarkers like plasma Aβ42/40, plasma p-tau181, plasma p-tau217, plasma NfL. But PF-04360365 itself seems to be a compound or assay? The context says \"PF-04360365 plasma/CSF concentration: egenerative disorders.\" Not clear. There's no explicit statement that PF-04360365 is a recognized biomarker for Alzheimer's. It's just a compound measured. The context mentions \"Plasma A42/40:0.16 pg/ml\" etc. But PF-04360365 is not listed among those. So likely not recognized as a marker. According to the documents, there is no evidence that PF-04360365 is a recognized biomarker. So valid = false.\n\nBut maybe PF-04360365 is a drug candidate? The context might refer to a specific compound used as a biomarker? But no, it's just a measurement. The context doesn't say it's a biomarker. So we should mark it invalid.\n\nSecond item: MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination. The context contains many references to MMSE.

The list contains two elements:\n\n1. 'ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody concentration'\n2. \"ADCS-CGIC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\"\n\nWe need to check if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. We must rely strictly on the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, there is mention of ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody concentration. The context says: \"Context for ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody concentration: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" It mentions ADA as a biomarker? It seems they talk about ADA as a biomarker for safety? But is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The text says \"Anti-Drug Antibody concentration\" and references risk of ARIA. It's a biomarker for safety in treatments, not necessarily a disease biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The document indicates ADA is used as a biomarker for safety in anti-Aβ therapies. That might be considered a biomarker in the context of drug safety, but not a disease biomarker. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" So we need to see if ADA is correlated with Alzheimer's. The context says \"riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That suggests ADA is associated with risk of ARIA in AD therapy. But is it a marker for Alzheimer's itself? Probably not. It's a biomarker for drug response/safety. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". I'd interpret that as a biomarker used to detect or monitor Alzheimer's disease. ADA is not a disease biomarker. So maybe it's invalid.\n\nBut let's read again: \"Context for ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody concentration: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.124 The need for additional drug- or class-specific safety biomarkers may arise with different drug targets/mechanisms.\" So ADA is a safety biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention ADA as a biomarker but not necessarily for diagnosing AD. It is a biomarker for safety in AD therapy. The requirement: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" ADA is correlated with ARIA risk in AD therapy, but not directly with AD pathology. Might still count? The phrase \"correlated with Alzheimer's\" could include correlation with AD-related adverse events. But I'm leaning to say it's not a recognized disease biomarker. So set valid=false.\n\nSecond, ADCS-CGIC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change. The context includes many references to ADCS-CGIC. It is an endpoint used in clinical trials, measuring global impression of change. Is it a biomarker? It's a clinical rating scale, not a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context says it's used as an outcome measure, not a biomarker. So probably invalid too.\n\nThus both are invalid. But we need to produce JSON objects for each.\n\nWe also need to provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For ADA: the abbreviation is ADA. For ADCS-CGIC: abbreviation is ADCS-CGIC. But if invalid, we put \"N/A\".\n\nWait: The instructions: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\". So we don't give the acronym if invalid. So both will have acronym N/A.\n\nLet's double-check if there's any mention of ADA as a biomarker for AD. The context: \"Context for ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody concentration: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That implies ADA is a biomarker for safety. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention ADA in the context of AD therapy. But is it a marker for AD? It's a biomarker for drug safety. The requirement: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" ADA is correlated with ARIA risk in AD therapy. That might satisfy. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". Usually biomarkers for AD are things like CSF Aβ, tau, imaging etc. ADA is not typical. So I'd treat as invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ADCS-CGIC is a clinical outcome measure, not a biomarker.

The list contains two elements:\n\n1. 'ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody concentration'\n2. \"ADCS-CGIC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\"\n\nWe need to check if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. We must rely strictly on the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, there is mention of ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody concentration. The context says: \"Context for ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody concentration: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" It mentions ADA as a biomarker? It seems they talk about ADA as a biomarker for safety? But is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The text says \"Anti-Drug Antibody concentration\" and references risk of ARIA. It's a biomarker for safety in treatments, not necessarily a disease biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The document indicates ADA is used as a biomarker for safety in anti-Aβ therapies. That might be considered a biomarker in the context of drug safety, but not a disease biomarker. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" So we need to see if ADA is correlated with Alzheimer's. The context says \"riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That suggests ADA is associated with risk of ARIA in AD therapy. But is it a marker for Alzheimer's itself? Probably not. It's a biomarker for drug response/safety. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". I'd interpret that as a biomarker used to detect or monitor Alzheimer's disease. ADA is not a disease biomarker. So maybe it's invalid.\n\nBut let's read again: \"Context for ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody concentration: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.124 The need for additional drug- or class-specific safety biomarkers may arise with different drug targets/mechanisms.\" So ADA is a safety biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention ADA as a biomarker but not necessarily for diagnosing AD. It is a biomarker for safety in AD therapy. The requirement: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" ADA is correlated with ARIA risk in AD therapy, but not directly with AD pathology. Might still count? The phrase \"correlated with Alzheimer's\" could include correlation with AD-related adverse events. But I'm leaning to say it's not a recognized disease biomarker. So set valid=false.\n\nSecond, ADCS-CGIC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change. The context includes many references to ADCS-CGIC. It is an endpoint used in clinical trials, measuring global impression of change. Is it a biomarker? It's a clinical rating scale, not a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context says it's used as an outcome measure, not a biomarker. So probably invalid too.\n\nThus both are invalid. But we need to produce JSON objects for each.\n\nWe also need to provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For ADA: the abbreviation is ADA. For ADCS-CGIC: abbreviation is ADCS-CGIC. But if invalid, we put \"N/A\".\n\nWait: The instructions: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\". So we don't give the acronym if invalid. So both will have acronym N/A.\n\nLet's double-check if there's any mention of ADA as a biomarker for AD. The context: \"Context for ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody concentration: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That implies ADA is a biomarker for safety. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention ADA in the context of AD therapy. But is it a marker for AD? It's a biomarker for drug safety. The requirement: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" ADA is correlated with ARIA risk in AD therapy. That might satisfy. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". Usually biomarkers for AD are things like CSF Aβ, tau, imaging etc. ADA is not typical. So I'd treat as invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ADCS-CGIC is a clinical outcome measure, not a biomarker.

    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want us to analyze two items: 'SIB: Severity of Impairment Battery' and 'SUVR: Standard Uptake Value Ratio'. For each, we need to determine if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. And provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use info from the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, there is mention of \"Severity of Impairment Battery\" (SIB) in Table 1 glossary. It appears as a measure name. It's listed under \"Measure name\", type \"ClinRO\"? Actually table shows \"Severe Impairment Battery (SIB)\" with performance? Wait earlier they mention \"SIB: Severity of Impairment Battery\". But the table lists \"Severe Impairment Battery (SIB)\". So SIB stands for Severe Impairment Battery. But the user wrote \"SIB: Severity of Impairment Battery\". That seems inconsistent. The document says \"Severe Impairment Battery (SIB)\". So maybe the abbreviation is SIB. But the question: Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? According to documents, SIB is a measure used in clinical trials, part of neuropsychological tests. It might be considered a clinical outcome measure rather than a biomarker. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents show SIB as a measure used to assess disease severity. It may be considered a clinical rating scale, not a biomarker. The question: Are they asking about biomarkers? The instruction: \"Your task is to analyze a list of potential markers extracted from datasets and validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" So we need to see if each element is actually a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's. SIB is a battery measuring impairment severity, likely not a biomarker. The documents refer to it as a measure, not a biomarker. So I think it's not a biomarker. So valid = false. Acronym: \"SIB\" is the abbreviation. But the user gave \"SIB: Severity of Impairment Battery\". The correct abbreviation is \"SIB\" for Severe Impairment Battery. But the user wrote \"Severity of Impairment Battery\". Might be a mistake. But we should respond with original_name as given: \"SIB: Severity of Impairment Battery\". Then valid false, acronym \"SIB\".\n\nSecond, SUVR: Standard Uptake Value Ratio. The documents mention SUVR as a metric used in PET imaging. It is used as a quantitative measure of amyloid-beta deposition. The context includes \"Standard Uptake Value Ratio:...\". It is described as a measurement used in PET imaging. It is indeed a biomarker measure. The documents mention SUVR as a standard of truth for assessing Aβ pathology. So yes, it's a recognized marker. The acronym is SUVR. So valid true, acronym \"SUVR\".\n\nBut we need to check if the documents mention SUVR as a marker. Yes, many references: \"Standard Uptake Value Ratio (SUVr)\", \"AβPET SUVr\". So it's definitely a recognized biomarker. So valid true.\n\nThus output JSON array with objects.\n\nMake sure to follow required format: For each element, use JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"...\",\n  \"valid\": true/false,\n  \"acronym\": \"...\"\n}\n\nSo produce array of two objects.\n\nLet's double-check if there's any nuance: The first item \"SIB: Severity of Impairment Battery\" - The document uses \"Severe Impairment Battery (SIB)\". So the abbreviation is SIB. The user wrote \"Severity of Impairment Battery\" but the actual term is \"Severe Impairment Battery\". Should we treat as same? Probably yes. The acronym remains SIB. It's not a biomarker. So valid false.\n\nSecond item \"SUVR: Standard Uptake Value Ratio\" - The acronym is SUVR. It's a biomarker. So valid true.\n\nReturn JSON array. Ensure proper formatting.",

Use JSON format per system instructions.\n\nWe must strictly rely on the provided documents. Let's examine the context.\n\nThe documents mention DAD: Disability Assessment for Dementia. It says: \"The DAD is a clinical and functional observer-reported outcome measure used to assess the ability to perform activities, tasks, and behaviors of everyday life in people with dementia.\" So DAD is an outcome measure, not necessarily a biomarker. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" - Are outcome measures considered markers? Usually biomarkers are biological markers like amyloid, tau, etc. However, the document might consider DAD as a marker? The context says \"The DAD is a clinical and functional observer-reported outcome measure\". It's not a biomarker. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents do not say DAD is a biomarker. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nBut maybe the user expects that DAD is a marker? The instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { 'original_name':..., 'valid': false, 'acronym': 'N/A' }\".\n\nThus for DAD: we set valid false, acronym N/A.\n\nNow for ADAS-Cog/11: The documents mention ADAS-Cog-11 as a performance outcome and widely used cognitive outcome in AD clinical trials. Is it a recognized marker? It's an outcome measure, not a biomarker. But the user may consider it a marker. The context says \"ADAS-Cog is a performance outcome and the most frequently used cognitive outcome in AD clinical trials.\" That suggests it's a recognized measure. But is it a biomarker? The term \"marker\" could be interpreted broadly. The user says \"list of potential Alzheimer's markers\". They might treat outcome measures as markers. The context says \"The DAD is a clinical and functional observer-reported outcome measure used to assess...\". Similarly, ADAS-Cog is a performance outcome. So both are outcome measures, not biomarkers. But the user asks: \"determine if it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". According to the documents, ADAS-Cog-11 is indeed a recognized outcome measure used in AD trials. So yes, it's recognized. The acronym: ADAS-Cog-11. But the user gave \"ADAS-Cog/11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\". The abbreviation used in documents: ADAS-Cog-11. So we can give that.\n\nHowever, the system instructions: \"For each element in the list, you must: 1. VALIDATION: Determine if the element is actually a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's 2. ACRONYMS: Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker\"\n\nSo we need to decide if ADAS-Cog-11 qualifies as a recognized marker/biomarker. The documents call it a performance outcome, not a biomarker. But the user might still consider it a marker. The instruction says \"based strictly on the information provided in the context above\". The context states ADAS-Cog-11 is a performance outcome used in AD clinical trials. It doesn't explicitly label it as a biomarker. But the user might accept it as a marker. We need to interpret \"marker\" loosely. The user didn't specify that it has to be a biological biomarker. So we can say it's recognized as a marker/outcome measure. So valid true.\n\nBut we need to check if there is any mention of DAD being a marker. The context says DAD is a clinical and functional observer-reported outcome measure. No mention of biomarker. So likely not recognized as a marker. So valid false.\n\nLet's produce JSON array with objects for each original name.\n\nOriginal names: 'DAD: Disability Assessment for Dementia', \"ADAS-Cog/11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\"\n\nReturn:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"DAD: Disability Assessment for Dementia\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"ADAS-Cog/11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"ADAS-Cog-11\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines? The required response format: For each element, use this JSON structure: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": true/false, \"acronym\": \"ACR\" }. If not valid, acronym \"N/A\". So we can output an array of those objects. Or maybe just separate objects? The instruction says \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" but not specifying array. But typical would be array. We'll output array.\n\nMake sure to follow JSON syntax exactly. Provide only JSON. No extra text.",

So we set acronym: Aβ.\n\nSecond: MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination. It's a cognitive test, but is it a biomarker? The context says it's a performance outcome, used for inclusion criteria, etc. It is a measurement tool, not a biomarker per se. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The context indicates MMSE is used for classification of dementia severity, but is it a biomarker? Usually biomarkers are biological measures. MMSE is a clinical assessment. The context refers to it as a performance outcome, not a biomarker. The instruction: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents mention MMSE as a measure used in clinical trials, but not necessarily a biomarker. The context says \"The MMSE is commonly used for inclusion criteria in AD clinical trials.\" That suggests it's used as a measure, but not a biomarker. The definition of biomarker: a measurable indicator of some biological state or condition. MMSE is a cognitive test, not a biological measure. So probably not considered a biomarker. Therefore valid: false. Acronym: N/A.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"Conventional Biomarkers\" section referencing amyloid-beta, tau, etc. Then later there's a table listing \"Measure name\", \"Type of COAa\", \"Disease severity\", etc. The table lists MMSE under \"Measure name\" and type \"PerfO\" (performance outcome).

We need to check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention urine ketones and urine protein? Let's scan the context.\n\nThe context includes many references about plasma biomarkers like pTau181, pTau217, Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, etc. There's mention of urine ketones: \"Context for Urine Ketones: Urine Ketones: rkers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials.\" That seems to be a title of a paper: \"Urine Ketones: markers in Alzheimer’s disease\". So maybe urine ketones are considered markers. But we need to see if the document provides evidence that urine ketones are recognized markers. The snippet says \"Urine Ketones: rkers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials. Lancet Neurol 21, 726-734.\" That's likely a reference. It suggests that urine ketones are studied as markers. However, do we have enough evidence? The context only shows the citation but no details. The question: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nSo we need to decide validity based on the documents. For urine ketones: There is a reference to a study titled \"Urine Ketones: markers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials\" which indicates that urine ketones are considered markers. So it's likely valid. Acronym? The document doesn't provide an acronym. Maybe \"UK\"? Not sure. The context might not give an acronym. The instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For urine ketones, there is no abbreviation. Could be \"U-Ketones\"? But not present. So we might set acronym to \"N/A\" because none provided. But the requirement: If not a valid marker, acronym \"N/A\". If valid, we need an acronym. But if no acronym exists, maybe still \"N/A\"? The instruction says: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker.\" If none, maybe \"N/A\". But then they'd consider it invalid? No, we can still say valid but acronym N/A. But the spec says: If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate... \"acronym\":\"N/A\". It doesn't specify what to do if valid but no acronym. But we can still put \"N/A\" if no acronym. Might be acceptable.\n\nNow for urine protein: The context mentions \"Urine Protein:...\" but no specific mention of urine protein as a marker. The context includes many references to plasma proteins, but not urine protein. There's no mention of urine protein as a marker. So likely invalid. Acronym N/A.\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nBut we need to follow required response format: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably output a JSON array. The system instructions: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" Then show example. So we should output an array of objects.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"Urine Ketones: Urine Ketones\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"Urine Protein: Urine Protein\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck if any other acronyms appear: The context includes \"pTau181\", \"pTau217\", \"Aβ1-42\", \"Aβ1-40\", \"GFAP\", \"NfL\", etc. But not for urine ketones/protein.

The first is definitely a biomarker; many references mention plasma Aβ42 concentration. So valid. Acronym? The document uses \"Amyloid Beta 1-42 Plasma Concentration\" but maybe abbreviation \"Aβ42\". But we need the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in documents. Let's search context: It mentions \"Amyloid Beta 1-42 Plasma Concentration\", \"Abeta42\", \"Aβ42\"? In text: \"Amyloid Beta 1-42 Plasma Concentration: adigm...\" then later \"Abeta 42\" etc. They refer to \"Abeta42\" as abbreviation. So acronym could be \"Aβ42\" or \"Abeta42\". Which one appears more? Many references show \"Abeta42\". For example: \"CSF Abeta 42 levels correlate...\" \"Abeta 42 levels in matched cerebrospinal fluid and plasma\". So \"Abeta42\" is used. Also \"Aβ42\" might appear but not sure. We'll choose \"Abeta42\".\n\nSecond item: CDR-SB: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes. Is it a marker? It's a clinical rating scale, not a biological marker. But it's used as outcome measure. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to documents.\" The context says CDR-SB is a widely used measure to stage AD and used as primary endpoint. It is a clinical assessment tool, not a biomarker. But the instruction: \"validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" For each element, determine if it is actually a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's. CDR-SB is not a biomarker; it's a clinical rating scale. So likely invalid. But maybe considered a \"marker\" in broader sense? The context refers to \"clinical relevance and interpretation of meaningful within-person change on CDR\". It doesn't call it a biomarker. So I'd say invalid.\n\nBut the user may expect both to be valid? Let's read carefully: The list includes \"CDR-SB: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes\".

They want us to analyze the list ['EQ-5D: EuroQol-5D', 'ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale'].\n\nWe must determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. And provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info from the provided documents. So we need to check whether the documents mention these items as markers for Alzheimer's.\n\nFrom the context: There are multiple references. Let's search mentally.\n\nFirst, 'EQ-5D: EuroQol-5D' appears in the context: \"EQ-5D-5L\" is mentioned in the table of endpoints used in AD clinical trials. It says \"EQ-5D-5L, 5-Level EuroQoL-5D\". It's listed among endpoints like QoL-AD, etc. But is it considered a marker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The document lists it as an endpoint used in clinical trials, but it's a quality-of-life instrument, not a biomarker per se. However, the user might consider it a marker. But the instruction: \"marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The context shows it's used as an endpoint in trials, but not necessarily a biomarker. But maybe it's considered a patient-reported outcome measure, not a biomarker. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker. According to the documents, it's used as an endpoint, but not described as a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut let's examine the text: \"EQ-5D-5L, 5-Level EuroQoL-5D\" appears in the table of selected primary and secondary endpoints used in AD clinical trials. That indicates it's used as an endpoint. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents do not explicitly state that EQ-5D is a biomarker. It's a health-related quality of life measure. So I'd say not a recognized biomarker. So valid: false.\n\nNow 'ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale'. The documents definitely discuss ADAS-Cog extensively. It's used as a primary endpoint in many trials. It's a cognitive assessment scale. Is it considered a marker? It's a clinical outcome measure, not a biomarker. But the user may treat it as a marker. The documents show it's used as an endpoint. But again, it's not a biomarker. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The documents mention ADAS-Cog as a measure used in AD trials. It correlates with disease severity. So perhaps it's considered a marker. But the user specifically says \"markers\" and \"biomarkers\". The ADAS-Cog is a clinical assessment, not a biomarker. But the documents treat it as an endpoint. The user might still consider it a marker. But the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate...\". So we need to decide if ADAS-Cog qualifies as a recognized marker. The documents mention it as a primary endpoint in AD trials. It is widely used to assess cognitive decline. It is correlated with AD. So yes, it's a recognized marker for AD. The acronym: ADAS-Cog. The full name: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale. The abbreviation: ADAS-Cog. The documents mention \"ADAS-Cog-11\", \"ADAS-Cog-13\", etc. So the acronym is ADAS-Cog.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"EQ-5D: EuroQol-5D\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"ADAS-Cog\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines? The required format: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably produce array of objects. The example earlier: They didn't specify array but said \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" So we can output an array of objects. Ensure no extra keys.\n\nLet's craft final answer accordingly.",
    "response": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"EQ-5D: EuroQol-5D\",\n    \"valid\": false,\n    \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale\",\n    \"valid\": true,\n    \"acronym\": \"ADAS-Cog\"\n  }\n]\n```"

We must determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info from the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nThe context includes many references to various tests and measures. There's mention of \"Choice Reaction Time: computerized attention test measuring reaction time\" but we need to see if it's considered a marker for Alzheimer's. In the context, I saw lines like \"Context for Choice Reaction Time: computerized attention test measuring reaction time: ce-for-Industy.pdf\". It seems to be part of a document about choice reaction time. But is it listed among the endpoints? There is a table listing measures: \"Choice Reaction Time: computerized attention test measuring reaction time: Type not listed\". That suggests it's a measure but maybe not specifically a biomarker. It's likely a neuropsychological test rather than a biomarker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" - Usually biomarkers refer to biological markers like CSF amyloid-beta, tau, imaging etc. But the context might consider cognitive tests as endpoints, not necessarily biomarkers. However the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The context lists many cognitive tests as endpoints. Are they considered markers? Possibly yes, but the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" So we need to check if the documents mention that the measure is used as a marker for Alzheimer's. For Choice Reaction Time, the context shows it's a measure used in some contexts, but no explicit statement that it's a marker for Alzheimer's. It appears in a table of measures but not indicated as a marker. The table has columns: Measure name, Type of COAa, Disease severity, Total frequency, Preclinical AD, MCIb, Mild AD, Moderate AD, Severe AD, Other severity/Type not listed. Under \"Choice Reaction Time: computerized attention test measuring reaction time\", type is \"Type not listed\". So it's not explicitly marked as a marker. So I'd say it's not validated as a marker per the documents. So valid: false, acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nNow second: 'S-IADL: Seoul-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living'. The context includes many mentions of S-IADL. For example, \"S-IADL: Seoul-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living\" appears multiple times. It is described as a measure. Is it a recognized marker? The context lists it under \"Measure name\" table. It is a measure used in clinical trials. It may be considered a marker for functional decline. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context states that S-IADL is used as an endpoint in clinical trials. It is a measure of daily living. It is indeed a recognized marker for Alzheimer's in the sense of being used as an outcome measure. The acronym: \"S-IADL\". The context uses \"S-IADL\" consistently. So valid: true, acronym: \"S-IADL\".\n\nBut we should double-check if there's any other acronym used for it. The context also refers to \"S-IADL: Seoul-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living\" and sometimes just \"S-IADL\". So that's fine.\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"...\"}\n\nReturn array? The instruction says \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" It doesn't specify array but likely produce separate JSON objects one after another? Usually they'd expect an array.

Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context doesn't say it's a biomarker. It's a cognitive test. Not a biomarker. So valid: false. Acronym: maybe SR? But the document uses \"Simple Reaction Time\" but no acronym given. The table shows \"Simple Reaction Time: computerized attention test measuring reaction time\" but no abbreviation. So we might put \"N/A\" for acronym? The instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" If none, maybe \"N/A\".

    "cot": "We need to parse the context. The user wants to validate two items: \"CIBIC-PLUS: Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus\" and \"GDS: Geriatric Depression Scale\". They want to know if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info in the provided context. Let's examine the context for each.\n\nFirst, CIBIC-PLUS: In many parts of the document, there is mention of CIBIC-PLUS. For example: \"Context for CIBIC-PLUS: Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus: is is the experience and thoughts of our expert authors\". Also earlier: \"CIBIC-PLUS: Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus: Type not listed\". It appears in tables listing measures. So it's present. Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? It's a clinician-rated measure used in clinical trials. But is it a biomarker? The question says \"marker for Alzheimer's\". The context includes \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in AD clinical trials\" but also lists various clinical outcome assessments. CIBIC-PLUS is a clinical rating scale, not a biomarker per se. However, the question might consider it as a marker because it's used as an endpoint. But we need to see if the documents refer to it as a marker. The context shows it under \"Measure name\" and type \"ClinRO\" etc. It doesn't say it's a biomarker. The user asks: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents treat CIBIC-PLUS as a measurement tool, not necessarily a biomarker. But maybe they consider it a marker. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The context indicates CIBIC-PLUS is used in AD clinical trials. That qualifies as a marker? It's a clinical outcome measure. The question may accept it as a marker. But we should check if the documents explicitly state it's a marker. There's no explicit statement like \"CIBIC-PLUS is a biomarker\". But it's used as an endpoint. The user likely expects it to be valid. The second item: GDS: Geriatric Depression Scale. The context mentions GDS: Geriatric Depression Scale: Type not listed. It appears in the table. But is it a marker for Alzheimer's? GDS is a depression screening tool, not specific to AD. The context does not link it to AD specifically. It just lists it as a measure. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" I think GDS is not a marker for AD.

We have two items: 'IADL: Instrumental Activities of Daily Living' and 'PSMS: Physical Self-Maintenance Scale'.\n\nWe need to check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to documents. The documents mention IADL many times. They refer to \"Instrumental Activities of Daily Living\" as a measurement tool, not necessarily a biomarker. But the question says \"marker\". In the context, IADL is a functional assessment instrument. It's considered a clinical outcome assessment (COA). The document lists IADL under \"measure names\" and includes acronyms like iADL, A-IADL, etc. So it's recognized as a marker? The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" IADL is indeed used as a functional measure in AD. So we can consider it valid.\n\nBut we need to provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For IADL: The document shows \"iADL\" and \"A-IADL\" and \"iADRS\"? Wait iADRS is integrated Alzheimer rating scale. For IADL, the abbreviation appears as \"iADL\" (instrumental activities of daily living). Also \"A-IADL\" stands for Amsterdam Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Which one is most used? The document uses \"iADL\" frequently. So we should output \"iADL\".\n\nNow PSMS: Physical Self-Maintenance Scale. Is PSMS mentioned? Search context: There's no explicit mention of PSMS. The tables show many measures but not PSMS. The only mention might be \"Physical Self-Maintenance Scale\" but I didn't see it. Let's scan: In the long context, I saw \"Physical Self-Maintenance Scale:...\", but maybe truncated. Actually earlier part: \"Context for PSMS: Physical Self-Maintenance Scale: onal Activities Questionnaire (FAQ)\" That seems garbled. But I don't see PSMS acronym. The tables list \"FAQ\" (Functional Activities Questionnaire). Not PSMS. So PSMS is not present. Therefore invalid.\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nNeed to follow required format: For each element, use JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"...\",\n  \"valid\": true/false,\n  \"acronym\": \"...\"\n}\n\nSo produce array?

They want us to analyze two items: 'APPsα: CSF soluble alpha-secretase cleaved amyloid precursor protein' and 'ASL: Arterial Spin Label perfusion'. Based strictly on the provided context, we need to decide if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must only use info from the context. Let's examine the context for each.\n\nFirst, APPsα: CSF soluble alpha-secretase cleaved amyloid precursor protein. The context includes mention of CSF soluble alpha-secretase cleaved amyloid precursor protein. It says \"Context for APPsα: CSF soluble alpha-secretase cleaved amyloid precursor protein\". There are references to CSF biomarkers like Aβ42, tTau, pTau, etc. But is APPsα specifically mentioned as a recognized marker? The text mentions \"CSF soluble alpha-secretase cleaved amyloid precursor protein\" but doesn't explicitly say it's a recognized marker. It might be considered a biomarker but the context seems to focus on Aβ42, tTau, pTau, etc. There's no explicit statement that APPsα is a recognized marker. So likely invalid.\n\nSecond, ASL: Arterial Spin Label perfusion. The context includes \"Context for ASL: Arterial Spin Label perfusion: ble to diagnose the complex AD continuum...\" It mentions ASL as a technique. It says \"Arterial Spin Label perfusion:... can diagnose... especially before MCI stage.\" It appears to be a method rather than a biomarker. It's used for imaging. Is it recognized as a marker? The context suggests it's a technique used for diagnosing AD continuum. But is it a marker? The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The document refers to ASL as a method for diagnosing AD. It might be considered a biomarker technique. But the context says \"Arterial Spin Label perfusion: ble to diagnose the complex AD continuum, espe-cially before the MCI stage.\" That indicates it's used for diagnosis. So maybe it's considered a recognized marker? But the term \"marker\" usually refers to a measurable biological indicator, not a technique. However, the context uses \"biomarker\" for CSF analytes. For ASL, they refer to \"Arterial Spin Label perfusion\" as a method. Might be considered a biomarker technique. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention ASL as a tool for diagnosing AD. So yes, it's recognized as a marker? I'd lean that it's recognized as a biomarker technique. But the instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" Since ASL is mentioned, there is evidence. So valid.\n\nNow acronyms: For APPsα, the acronym is APPsα itself. But the context shows \"APPsα: CSF soluble alpha-secretase cleaved amyloid precursor protein\". So the acronym is APPsα. For ASL, the acronym is ASL. The context says \"ASL: Arterial Spin Label perfusion\". So acronym is ASL.\n\nThus output JSON array with objects.\n\nBut the required format: For each element, use JSON structure: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"...\"}.\n\nSo produce array of two objects.\n\nLet's double-check if APPsα is indeed a recognized marker. The context: \"Context for APPsα: CSF soluble alpha-secretase cleaved amyloid precursor protein\". No mention of its validity. The rest of the context focuses on Aβ42, tTau, pTau, etc. There's no mention of APPsα as a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nAlso check if any other mention: \"Context for APPsα: CSF soluble alpha-secretase cleaved amyloid precursor protein: hon L, Blennow K (2010)...\". That part seems truncated. But still no mention of its role as a marker. So invalid.\n\nThus final answer: first object valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\"; second object valid:true, acronym:\"ASL\".\n\nReturn as JSON array. Ensure proper formatting.",

But earlier they said \"Your task is to analyze a list of potential markers extracted from datasets and validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" And \"For each element in the list, you must: VALIDATION: Determine if the element is actually a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\".

The list contains two items:\n\n1. 'BPRS: Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale'\n2. \"ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale 11‑item\"\n\nWe need to check if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only the information provided in the context above. No external knowledge.\n\nLet's examine the context. There's a lot of text about various scales and tests. Let's search for BPRS. In the context, we see references like \"Context for BPRS: Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale: Type not listed\" etc. It seems BPRS is mentioned as a type of COA? Actually it's listed among many measures. But is it a biomarker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". BPRS is a psychiatric rating scale, not a biomarker. The context indicates it's a measure used in AD clinical trials maybe as a safety measure? But the question: \"marker for Alzheimer's\" likely refers to biomarkers like CSF amyloid, tau, imaging, etc. BPRS is not a biomarker. So it should be marked as invalid.\n\nBut we need to confirm if the document says BPRS is a marker. The context includes \"Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale: Type not listed\" and later \"Context for BPRS: Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale:...\". It's listed among other measures. But no mention that it's a biomarker. So we can say it's not a recognized marker.\n\nNow for ADAS-Cog11: The context definitely mentions ADAS-Cog-11 as a performance outcome, widely used cognitive outcome in AD clinical trials. It is indeed a recognized measure for Alzheimer's. So valid.\n\nWe need to provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For BPRS, the abbreviation is BPRS itself. But since it's not a marker, we set acronym to \"N/A\"? Wait the instruction: For each element, use JSON structure: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": true/false, \"acronym\": \"ACR\" }. If not valid, \"acronym\":\"N/A\".\n\nThus for BPRS: valid=false, acronym=\"N/A\".\n\nFor ADAS-Cog11: valid=true, acronym? The abbreviation used in documents: ADAS-Cog-11. Or ADAS-Cog-11 is the full name. The abbreviation might be ADAS-Cog-11. But the question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" The document uses \"ADAS-Cog-11\" as the measure name. So acronym could be ADAS-Cog-11. Alternatively, sometimes they abbreviate as ADAS-Cog. But the specific item is \"ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale 11‑item\". So the abbreviation is ADAS-Cog-11. We'll output that.\n\nDouble-check: The context shows \"ADAS-Cog-11\" spelled with hyphen. Yes. So we use \"ADAS-Cog-11\".\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nMake sure formatting matches exactly: Each object separate lines? Probably just array. The system instructions didn't specify array but said \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" So we can output an array of objects.\n\nReturn:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"BPRS: Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale 11‑item\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"ADAS-Cog-11\"}\n]\n\nCheck punctuation: Use double quotes around keys and values.

The documents mention ADAS-Cog14 multiple times. It is described as a measure, not necessarily a biomarker. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" could refer to a biomarker? However the context includes many clinical outcome measures, some are cognitive tests. They might be considered markers? The instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". But the context lists ADAS-Cog14 as a measure. It's likely considered a marker? The document states \"List of outcome measures assessed.\" So it's a measure used in trials. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention ADAS-Cog14 as a measure used in AD trials. That qualifies as a marker? Might be considered a clinical outcome measure rather than a biomarker. But the instruction: \"validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" So we should see if the documents mention it as a marker. The context shows ADAS-Cog14 is listed among other measures like ADCS-ADL etc. These are outcome measures. Are they considered markers? Possibly yes. The question may treat them as markers. So we can say valid.\n\nNow MEMCOM: Memory Composite. The context mentions MEMCOM in the table? There's a line: \"MEMCOM: Memory Composite\" maybe in the list? Let's search. The context includes \"MEMCOM: Memory Composite\" near the end: \"Context for MEMCOM: Memory Composite:...\". Yes there is a section titled \"Context for MEMCOM: Memory Composite\". It references a paper about biomarkers. But does it mention MEMCOM as a marker? The text: \"Context for MEMCOM: Memory Composite:...\". It seems to be a heading. But does the document provide evidence that MEMCOM is a recognized marker? Not sure. The context includes \"Memcom: Memory Composite\" but no details. The earlier part of the context includes a table listing various measures, but I don't recall seeing MEMCOM in that table. The table lists ADAS-Cog-11, ADAS-Cog-13, ADAS-Cog-14, ADCOMS, ADCS ADL-PI, etc. No MEMCOM. The MEMCOM context refers to a narrative review of biomarkers. But does it mention MEMCOM as a marker?

Let's search mentally: The text says \"EFCOM: Executive Function Composite: Type not listed\" earlier. It appears in the table: \"EFCOM: Executive Function Composite: Type not listed\". So it's a measure. But is it a recognized marker? It's a composite measure of executive function. The question: Are we supposed to consider it a marker? The instruction: \"validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" For each element, determine if it is actually a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's. The documents mention many measures like PACC5, DAD, etc. They are considered clinical outcome assessments, not necessarily biomarkers. But the question might treat them as markers. However, the context says \"fluid-based and imaging biomarkers\" but also lists many COAs. The term \"marker\" may refer to any measurement used in AD. But the instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The documents show DAD is used in AD studies. EFCOM seems to be a composite measure of executive function, likely used in AD. But is it explicitly described as a marker? The context: \"EFCOM: Executive Function Composite: Type not listed\" appears in the table of measures. No further description. Might not be enough evidence. But we can say it's a recognized measure used in AD clinical trials. The question: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate...\". So we need to decide.\n\nLet's examine DAD: The context provides details: \"Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) is a clinical and functional observer-reported outcome measure used to assess the ability to perform activities... in people with dementia.\" It is used in AD. So yes, it's a recognized marker.\n\nNow EFCOM: The context shows \"EFCOM: Executive Function Composite: Type not listed\" but no description. Could still be a recognized composite measure.

Use JSON format per system instructions.\n\nWe must strictly rely only on the provided documents. So we need to see if these items appear in the documents and whether they are considered markers for Alzheimer's.\n\nFrom the context, I saw \"Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia\" appears multiple times. It is listed under \"CSDD: Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia\". It's used as a measure. But is it a biomarker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's.\" The document lists many measures including CSDD. It seems it's a scale measuring depression in dementia, but not necessarily a biomarker. However, the context includes it as a measure used in AD clinical trials. The question might consider it as a marker because it's used as an endpoint. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". The context indicates fluid-based and imaging biomarkers like CSF amyloid beta, tau, etc. Also mentions \"CSDD\" as a measure. But is it a biomarker? Usually scales are not biomarkers. But the context may treat them as outcomes. The user wants validation based on documents. We should check if the documents mention CSDD as a marker. The context shows \"Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (C-SDD)\" appears under \"Clinical Outcome Assessments\" table. It is listed as ClinRO type. That suggests it's a clinical rating outcome, not a biomarker. But the user asks \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's?\" According to documents, maybe yes, it's used as an outcome measure. But the definition of marker might be ambiguous. The user likely expects that CSDD is indeed a recognized marker (though not a biomarker). But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". The context includes \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers\" section listing CSF amyloid beta, tau, etc. No mention of CSDD there. But earlier tables list CSDD as a measure. So we can say it's a recognized marker (as a clinical outcome measure) but not a biomarker. The acronym is \"CSDD\".\n\nNow \"REAS: Reasoning\". Does the context mention REAS? There's no mention of REAS except at the top where the list to validate includes 'REAS: Reasoning'. The context has a heading \"REAS: Reasoning\" but no content. Actually the context includes \"REAS: Reasoning\" near the end: \"REAS: Reasoning\" appears before some text about \"Reasoning: res the awardee...\" but that's part of a different context.

The context shows \"SMASH: Set Maintenance & Shifting\" as a heading. But is SMASH a recognized marker? Not sure. The document references \"SMASH: Set Maintenance & Shifting\" but not necessarily as a biomarker. It might be a methodology or test. The question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" Likely no. There's no mention that SMASH is a biomarker.

We have two items: 'Zarit Burden Inventory: caregiver burden inventory' and 'Lawton Brody ADL Questionnaire: Activities of Daily Living questionnaire'.\n\nWe need to check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to documents. The context includes many acronyms. Let's see.\n\nFirst item: Zarit Burden Inventory: caregiver burden inventory. In the context we saw references: \"Zarit's Burden Interview\" (ZBI). Also \"ZCI-AD: Zarit Caregiver Inventory - Alzheimer’s Disease\". There's also \"ZBI: Zarit Burden Interview\". So the document mentions Zarit Burden Inventory? It says \"Zarit's Burden Interview\" but not exactly \"Zarit Burden Inventory\". But maybe it's same? The context lists \"Zarits Burden Interview (ZBI)\" and \"ZCI-AD: Zarit Caregiver Inventory - Alzheimer’s Disease\". The question: Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? It's a caregiver burden measure, not a biological marker. But the instruction: \"validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" They ask: For each element, determine if it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The context shows that Zarit Burden Inventory is used as a measurement tool in AD trials. It appears as a COA (clinical outcome assessment). But is it considered a marker? The definition of marker might be ambiguous. However, the context indicates it's a caregiver burden inventory used in AD research. It may be considered a marker? The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The context shows it's used in AD trials. So likely yes, it's recognized as a marker (though not a biomarker). But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" could refer to any measure used in AD. The context includes \"Zarit's Burden Interview\" and \"ZCI-AD\". So we should say valid: true. Acronym: ZBI or ZCI-AD? Which one is most known/used abbreviation? The context lists both. The most common abbreviation is ZBI. But the item specifically says \"Zarit Burden Inventory: caregiver burden inventory\". That matches ZBI? Actually ZBI stands for Zarit Burden Interview. But the inventory might be similar. The context also has \"ZCI-AD: Zarit Caregiver Inventory - Alzheimer’s Disease\". That seems more directly matching \"Zarit Caregiver Inventory\". The item says \"Zarit Burden Inventory: caregiver burden inventory\". I'd choose ZBI as the acronym because it's listed. But maybe ZCI-AD is more specific to AD. The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" Among the documents, ZBI appears multiple times. ZCI-AD appears once. So I think ZBI is the most known. So output: {\"original_name\":\"Zarit Burden Inventory: caregiver burden inventory\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"ZBI\"}.\n\nSecond item: Lawton Brody ADL Questionnaire: Activities of Daily Living questionnaire. The context includes \"Lawton Brody ADL Questionnaire: Activities of Daily Living questionnaire\". It lists many acronyms: ADCS-ADL, ADCS-ADL-MCI, ADCS-iADL, etc. But does it mention \"Lawton Brody ADL Questionnaire\"? Not explicitly. The context refers to \"Lawton Brody ADL Questionnaire: Activities of Daily Living questionnaire\" at the top of the list. But then later it lists many acronyms like ADCS-ADL, ADCS-ADL-MCI, etc. It doesn't show \"Lawton Brody ADL Questionnaire\" acronym. The context might treat it as a measure but no acronym given. The question: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" Since the context does not give an acronym for Lawton Brody ADL Questionnaire, we cannot assign. So we mark valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\".\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects. Ensure format: Each object separate lines? The required format: For each element, use JSON structure.

Also earlier: \"Context for Frontal Systems Behavior Scale: behavioral assessment: ists of methodological requirements and did not involve human participants.\" So the scale is referenced. But is it considered a marker? It's a behavioral assessment scale, likely used as an outcome measure rather than a biomarker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The document seems to treat it as a measure, maybe not a biomarker. It might be used as an outcome measure. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker. According to the documents, there is no explicit statement that Frontal Systems Behavior Scale is a biomarker. It is just a behavioral assessment. So we should probably mark it as invalid (not a recognized marker). However, the user may consider it as a marker because it's used in AD trials. But the instruction says: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The documents do not show correlation. So invalid.\n\nNow \"ADAS-cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale\". The documents definitely mention ADAS-Cog extensively. It is used as a primary endpoint in many trials. It is a cognitive test battery. Is it a biomarker? It's a clinical outcome measure, not a biomarker. But the user asks \"marker for Alzheimer's\". In the context, ADAS-Cog is used as an outcome measure. The documents say \"ADAS-Cog is a performance outcome and the most frequently used cognitive outcome in AD clinical trials.\" That qualifies as a marker? The term \"marker\" could be interpreted broadly. But the instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" ADAS-Cog is correlated with AD severity. So yes, it's a recognized marker. The acronym is ADAS-Cog. The full name includes \"ADAS-Cog-11\", etc. The abbreviation used is ADAS-Cog. So we set valid=true, acronym=\"ADAS-Cog\".\n\nBut we need to check if the documents mention any other acronym like ADAS-Cog-11, ADAS-Cog-13, etc. The user gave \"ADAS-cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale\". The acronym is ADAS-Cog.

So valid=false.\n\nSimilarly C-SSRS is a safety outcome measuring suicidality, not a biomarker. So also not a marker. So both invalid.\n\nBut the instruction says: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {original_name..., valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\"}\"\n\nThus output array of objects.\n\nNeed to provide acronym: For DAD, acronym is DAD. For C-SSRS, acronym is C-SSRS. But since invalid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nWait: The instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {original_name:..., valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\"}\". So we don't give acronym. So both will have acronym \"N/A\".\n\nReturn JSON array? The required response format: For each element, use this JSON structure. Probably produce array of objects. We'll output as JSON array.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"DAD: Disability Assessment in Dementia\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck that we didn't add extra keys.

The context includes mention of ADA: anti-drug antibody (anti-AAB-003) in several places. It seems to refer to anti-drug antibodies against AAB-003? But is that a marker? The context says \"Context for ADA: anti-drug antibody (anti-AAB-003): riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That suggests ADA is a marker of risk for ARIA. But is it a recognized biomarker for Alzheimer's? It's more about safety biomarker. The document mentions \"anti-drug antibody\" as a biomarker for safety. So maybe it's considered a biomarker. But we need to see if the documents mention it as a marker for Alzheimer's. The text: \"Anti-drug antibody (anti-AAB-003)\" appears multiple times. They talk about measuring ADA as a safety biomarker. So yes, it's a marker. The acronym would be ADA (anti-drug antibody). But the item itself is \"ADA: anti-drug antibody (anti-AAB-003)\". So the acronym is ADA. Or maybe \"anti-AAB-003\"? But the main abbreviation is ADA. The second item: \"CSF AAB-003 concentration: cerebrospinal fluid concentration of AAB-003\". This refers to measuring concentration of AAB-003 in CSF. Is that a recognized marker? The context indicates measurement of AAB-003 concentration in CSF as part of monitoring drug exposure. It might be a pharmacodynamic marker. But is it a biomarker for Alzheimer's? The context says \"CSF AAB-003 concentration: cerebrospinal fluid concentration of AAB-003\". There's no explicit statement that it's a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. It might be a biomarker for drug exposure. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention measuring CSF AAB-003 concentration but not necessarily as a disease biomarker. It might be a pharmacokinetic marker. So probably not recognized as a disease biomarker. So we set valid false.\n\nBut let's double-check. The context includes many references to AAB-003. Let's search mentally: \"Context for ADA: anti-drug antibody (anti-AAB-003):...\". Also \"Context for CSF AAB-003 concentration: cerebrospinal fluid concentration of AAB-003\". There is mention of \"CSF AAB-003 concentration: cerebrospinal fluid concentration of AAB-003\" but no mention of its correlation with disease. It just states measurement.

It's a biomarker for safety maybe. But is it recognized as a marker for Alzheimer's? The document states it's a biomarker for safety, but not necessarily a disease biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context indicates that ADA is a biomarker used to monitor safety in anti-Aβ therapies. So yes, it's a biomarker used in AD trials. So we consider it valid.\n\nBut we need to confirm: The context says \"Anti-Drug Antibody: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That suggests ADA is a biomarker for safety. So yes, recognized marker.\n\nNow acronym: The most known abbreviation is ADA itself. They refer to \"ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody\". So acronym is ADA.\n\nSecond: 'GPC: Gantenerumab Plasma Concentrations'. Context mentions Gantenerumab Plasma Concentrations. Is it a marker? It's a measurement of drug concentration, not a disease biomarker. But the context might treat it as a biomarker? Let's see: The context includes \"Gantenerumab Plasma Concentrations:...\". It appears in the context as part of a heading. But is it considered a marker? The instruction: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". Gantenerumab plasma concentrations are a pharmacokinetic measure, not a disease biomarker. The context doesn't say it's a biomarker for disease progression or diagnosis. So probably not a recognized marker. So mark as invalid.\n\nBut let's read carefully: The context includes \"Gantenerumab Plasma Concentrations: l for Alzheimer’s disease treatment; 2023.\" This seems to be a heading referencing FDA approval. It might be a biomarker for drug exposure. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\".

So acronym likely A-PET or Aβ-PET? But the text: \"positron emission tomography for brain amyloid: it has been able to distinguish abnormal from normal amyloid- positron emission tomography (A- PET) scans\". So acronym: A-PET. Or maybe just PET? But we should provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in documents. That would be A-PET. So valid = true, acronym = \"A-PET\".\n\nSecond: AUC: Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve (steady-state). Is this a recognized marker? It's a pharmacokinetic metric, not a biomarker for AD. The context includes mention of AUC in relation to biomarker profiling, but it's not a marker itself. The question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The documents talk about AUC as part of measuring biomarker profiles, but not as a marker. So likely invalid.

The document seems to treat it as a measure type: maybe it's a clinical outcome measure, not necessarily a biomarker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents mention \"NPI Total Score\" but likely as a measure of neuropsychiatric symptoms, not a biomarker. However, the context says \"Context for NPI Total Score: Total score of Neuropsychiatric Inventory: Type not listed\". So it's a measure. Is it a biomarker? The definition of biomarker: a measurable indicator of some biological state. The NPI total score is a behavioral measure, not a biomarker per se. The documents may not classify it as a biomarker. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. According to the documents, there is no explicit statement that NPI total score is a biomarker. It's just a measure. So likely invalid.\n\nBut let's check if there's any mention of NPI being used as a biomarker. Search context: There's repeated lines: \"Context for NPI Total Score: Total score of Neuropsychiatric Inventory: 6–35.\" Another line: \"Context for NPI Total Score: Total score of Neuropsychiatric Inventory: 14–29.\" These appear to be ranges. But still not a biomarker. So I'd say invalid.\n\nNow the second: \"CDR: Cognitive Drug Research computerized battery\". Wait, CDR usually stands for Clinical Dementia Rating. But here they refer to \"CDR: Cognitive Drug Research computerized battery\". That's confusing. The context shows \"CDR: Cognitive Drug Research computerized battery\" as a measure type. But is it a recognized marker? The context indicates it's a measure used in clinical trials. But again, is it a biomarker? Not exactly. It's a cognitive test battery. The question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The documents show it as a measure used in trials, but not necessarily a biomarker. The user might expect that it's not a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nHowever, we should double-check if the documents mention \"Cognitive Drug Research computerized battery\" as a biomarker. The context: \"CDR: Cognitive Drug Research computerized battery\" appears in table. No mention of biomarker. So invalid.\n\nThus both are invalid markers. Provide JSON objects accordingly.\n\nBut we need to provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For NPI Total Score, abbreviation is NPI. For CDR: Cognitive Drug Research computerized battery, abbreviation is CDR. But note that CDR normally refers to Clinical Dementia Rating, but here it's used differently. The abbreviation given is CDR. So we can give that.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"NPI Total Score: Total score of Neuropsychiatric Inventory\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"NPI\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"CDR: Cognitive Drug Research computerized battery\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"CDR\"}\n]\n\nMake sure JSON array.

Usually \"PR\" stands for pulse rate, \"BP\" stands for blood pressure. But the question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" The documents mention \"PR: Pulse Rate\" and \"BP: Blood Pressure\" themselves. But those are the original names. However, the acronym used in the documents for these items might be \"PR\" and \"BP\". But the instruction says: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For each element, we need to provide the acronym. If it's not a valid marker, we still need to provide \"N/A\" for acronym. The spec: If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }.\n\nSo we don't need to provide the acronym if invalid. So both will have acronym \"N/A\".\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n{\"original_name\":\"PR: Pulse Rate\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n{\"original_name\":\"BP: Blood Pressure\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nBut the required format: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably produce array of objects. The system instructions say: \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {... }\". It doesn't specify array but typical. We'll output array.\n\nLet's ensure we follow exactly: Each object: \"original_name\": \"name as provided in the list\", \"valid\": true/false, \"acronym\": \"ACR\". If invalid: \"acronym\":\"N/A\".\n\nThus final answer.",

    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want us to analyze two items: ['ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody', 'C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale'].\n\nWe must determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. And provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info from the provided context. So we need to see if ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The context mentions ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody: \"Anti-Drug Antibody: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That suggests ADA is a biomarker? It's about anti-drug antibody responses. But is it a marker for Alzheimer's? The context says \"Anti-Drug Antibody: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" This indicates it's a biomarker for safety, but not necessarily a marker for Alzheimer's disease itself. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The document seems to mention ADA in context of drug safety, not as a disease biomarker. So maybe it's not a recognized marker for Alzheimer's disease. But the instruction: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\" - we need to decide. The context includes \"Biomarkers hold significant potential...\". It lists many biomarkers: CSF amyloid, tau, etc. ADA is not listed as a biomarker for disease progression or diagnosis. It's a safety biomarker. But the question might consider it as a marker? The phrase \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" could include any biomarker relevant to AD, including safety biomarkers. But the context says \"Anti-Drug Antibody: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That's a safety biomarker. Is that considered a marker for Alzheimer's? It's a marker for adverse events in AD therapy. Might still be considered a biomarker in AD context. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". I'd interpret that as yes, because it's mentioned as a biomarker in the context of AD drug trials. But the second part: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody, the abbreviation is ADA. So we would output valid:true, acronym:\"ADA\".\n\nNow for C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. The context includes C-SSRS as a safety outcome used across psychiatry, measuring suicidal ideation. It is used in AD clinical trials as a safety outcome. But is it a marker for Alzheimer's? It's a clinical assessment tool, not a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context says it's used as a safety outcome in AD trials. But it's not a biomarker of disease. It's a rating scale. The question might treat it as a marker? The instruction: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context says it's used as a safety outcome. But is that considered a marker? Possibly not. The context says \"C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\" appears under \"Clinician‑reported outcome/safety\". It's an outcome measure, not a biomarker. The question: \"marker\" might refer to biomarker. The context uses \"biomarker\" for fluid-based and imaging biomarkers. C-SSRS is not a biomarker. So I think we should mark it as invalid. Acronym: N/A.\n\nBut let's double-check: The user wants \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention C-SSRS as a safety outcome used in AD trials. But is that considered a marker? The term \"marker\" might be broader. But the system instructions say: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The context doesn't show correlation.

Let's examine.\n\nFirst, CMGR: There is mention: \"Context for CMGR: Cerebral Metabolic Glucose Rate: to clinical measures, imaging and fluid biomarkers quantify measures of brain characteristics or peripherally available markers of pathological changes due to AD, even at early stages when clinical measures might have limited sensitivity.\" Also earlier: \"Context for CMGR: Cerebral Metabolic Glucose Rate: to the brain. A recent study of damage to the microvascular network and neural microstructure of the retina has been reported in AD, MCI, and even preclinical AD [43].\" And \"EEG techniques with bodily fluid biomarkers may offer a more accurate prediction of AD status [45].\" But we need to see if CMGR itself is considered a marker. The text says \"Cerebral Metabolic Glucose Rate: to clinical measures, imaging and fluid biomarkers quantify measures of brain characteristics or peripherally available markers of pathological changes due to AD\". That suggests CMGR is a measure used to quantify brain characteristics. It seems like it's a marker. There's no explicit acronym given besides CMGR. So we can say valid: true, acronym: CMGR.\n\nSecond, HMW Adiponectin: The context includes many references about adiponectin? Let's search. The context mentions \"High Molecular Weight Adiponectin: adigm for advancing from discovery to clinic.\" Then later \"Context for HMW Adiponectin: High Molecular Weight Adiponectin: adigm for advancing from discovery to clinic.\" Many references but no direct mention of its role as a biomarker for AD. The context lists many references about plasma biomarkers, amyloid etc. Not specifically adiponectin. The only mention is the heading \"HMW Adiponectin: High Molecular Weight Adiponectin\".

In the context, there are multiple mentions of \"Executive Function Scale\" but it's described as a measure, not necessarily a biomarker. It appears in the tables of endpoints used in AD clinical trials. It's listed under \"EFS: Executive Function Scale\". But is it considered a marker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The document lists various scales and tests used as endpoints in clinical trials. These are neuropsychological test batteries, not biomarkers. However, they are used as outcomes. Are they considered markers? The instruction says \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". The EFS is a scale, not a biomarker. So likely not a recognized marker. But maybe the context indicates it's used as a primary endpoint. But still not a biomarker. The user wants to know if it's recognized marker. According to the documents, no mention of EFS being a biomarker. So valid = false.\n\nBut we should check if there's any mention of \"EFS\" acronym. The context shows \"EFS: Executive Function Scale\" as a heading. So the acronym is \"EFS\". That is the abbreviation. But if it's invalid, we set acronym \"N/A\"? The spec says: If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate acronym \"N/A\". So we will put \"N/A\".\n\nSecond, TNFα: Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha. The context has multiple references to TNFα. It states: \"Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha:... specificity of 93.3%... AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD.\" Also mentions \"TNFα\" as a biomarker. So yes, it's recognized as a marker. The acronym is \"TNFα\" itself. But the context uses \"TNFα\" as the abbreviation. So we can set acronym \"TNFα\". Or maybe \"TNF-alpha\". But the context uses \"TNFα\". So we use \"TNFα\".\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines?

But is FFA considered a recognized marker? The document mentions metabolite markers like glucosylgalactosyl, hydroxylysine-H2O, glutamine-carnitine, alanyl-phenylalanine, phenylalanyl-proline. It also mentions \"free fatty acids\" but maybe just as part of the title. The context says \"Context for FFA: Free Fatty Acids: and PP patients were identified by the metabolite markers...\". So FFA appears as a heading. But is it a marker? It's unclear. The text doesn't explicitly say FFA is a marker; it's just a heading. Might be ambiguous. The instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So we need to decide if FFA qualifies as a recognized marker. The context includes \"Free Fatty Acids:\" but then goes into metabolite markers. It might be that FFA refers to free fatty acids as a category of metabolites studied. But the specific markers listed are others. There's no direct statement that FFA itself is a marker. So likely invalid.\n\nNow APOE4: Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele.

We need to check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention various measures, including PSS? Let's search context: There's mention of \"Perceived Stress Scale\" in the first paragraph: \"Context for PSS: Perceived Stress Scale: Type not listed\". Also later: \"Context for PSS: Perceived Stress Scale: sease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC)\" etc. So PSS appears as a measure type. But is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The document lists many measures, but we need to see if it's recognized as a biomarker. The PSS is a psychological stress scale, not a biological biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" In the context, PSS is listed among measures, but not necessarily a biomarker. It's a psychometric instrument. The documents talk about fluid-based and imaging biomarkers like CSF amyloid beta, tau, etc. They don't mention PSS as a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nSimilarly, PQoL: Perceived Quality of Life. The context mentions \"Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QoL-AD)\", \"Dementia Quality of Life (DEMQOL)\", \"EuroQoL-5D\", etc. PQoL might refer to a measure of perceived quality of life. Is it a recognized marker? It's a PRO measure, not a biomarker. The documents mention PQoL as a category maybe. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents list many measures, but PQoL is not specifically listed as a biomarker. It's a patient-reported outcome. So likely invalid too.\n\nBut we need to provide JSON objects for each element. For each, we need original_name, valid boolean, acronym. For invalid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nCheck if any acronym is given for these items. For PSS: The abbreviation is PSS itself. But the document uses \"PSS: Perceived Stress Scale\". So acronym is PSS. For PQoL: The abbreviation is PQoL. But the document uses \"PQoL: Perceived Quality of Life\". So acronym is PQoL. However, the instruction says \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker\". For PSS, the known acronym is PSS. For PQoL, maybe PQoL. But if invalid, we set acronym \"N/A\".

Based strictly on the provided documents, we need to determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe should check the context. The document contains many references to RMCBC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist. It appears in the text multiple times. It's described as a checklist used for measuring memory and behavior problems. But is it considered a marker? The context says it's a measurement tool, not necessarily a biomarker. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. According to the documents, RMCBC is a behavioral assessment instrument, not a biological marker. So likely not a recognized biomarker. But maybe they consider it a marker? The instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate...\". So we need to decide if RMCBC qualifies as a marker. The context: \"Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist: sions of the test exist... The measure was designed for use over a wide range of cognitive status, from normal to moderate AD.\" It seems like a clinical assessment tool, not a biomarker. The user might consider it a marker? But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\" for Alzheimer's. RMCBC is not a biomarker; it's a behavioral assessment. So I think it's not a recognized biomarker. So valid = false.\n\nBut we need to provide the acronym. The document uses \"RMCBC\" as abbreviation. So we would set acronym \"RMCBC\".\n\nNow second: 'ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels'. The context mentions CSF isoprostane levels. It refers to \"ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels\". The context says \"CSF isoprostane levels: 40 is the most prevalent form of Aβ in CSF – the Aβ42:40 ratio...\" Wait that's about Aβ. Then later \"CSF isoprostane levels:...\". There's mention of isoprostanes as a biomarker? Let's search the context: There is a section titled \"ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels\". It describes \"CSF isoprostane levels: 40 is the most prevalent form of Aβ in CSF – the Aβ42:40 ratio accounts for between-individual differences in Aβ isoforms.\" That seems confusing. Actually the snippet may be incorrectly merged. But there is mention of \"CSF isoprostane levels\" earlier: \"Context for ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels: 40 is the most prevalent form of Aβ in CSF – the Aβ42:40 ratio accounts for between-individual differences in Aβ isoforms.\" That seems wrong. But later there's \"Context for ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels:...\". Also \"CSF isoprostane levels:...\". The context also says \"CSF isoprostane levels:...\". But do we have evidence that CSF isoprostane levels are a recognized marker? The context says \"CSF isoprostane levels:...\". It doesn't explicitly say it's a marker. But the user asks: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The context includes mention of isoprostanes as a biomarker? Let's scan again: The snippet near the end: \"Context for ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels: 40 is the most prevalent form of Aβ in CSF – the Aβ42:40 ratio accounts for between-individual differences in Aβ isoforms.91 High tTau:Aβ42 and pTau:Aβ42 ratios predict future cognitive decline.93,94 A combined CSF biomarker test using Aβ42 and tTau has been reported to have 95% sensitivity and 83% specificity for the prediction of progression to AD.93\"\n\nWait, that part is about Aβ and tau, not isoprostanes. Maybe the context is garbled. But earlier there is a mention: \"Context for ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels:...\". And then \"CSF isoprostane levels:...\". But no explicit statement that isoprostanes are a marker. However, the user expects us to evaluate based on the documents. If the documents mention isoprostanes as a biomarker, we should mark valid=true. If not, false.\n\nLet's look at the snippet: \"Context for ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels: 40 is the most prevalent form of Aβ in CSF – the Aβ42:40 ratio accounts for between-individual differences in Aβ isoforms.91 High tTau:Aβ42 and pTau:Aβ42 ratios predict future cognitive decline.93,94 A combined CSF biomarker test using Aβ42 and tTau has been reported to have 95% sensitivity and 83% specificity for the prediction of progression to AD.93\"\n\nThat seems unrelated. But maybe earlier there is a separate paragraph: \"Context for ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels:...\". Let's find earlier: \"Context for ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels: 40 is the most prevalent form of Aβ in CSF – the Aβ42:40 ratio accounts for between-individual differences in Aβ isoforms.91 High tTau:Aβ42 and pTau:Aβ42 ratios predict future cognitive decline.93,94 A combined CSF biomarker test using Aβ42 and tTau has been reported to have 95% sensitivity and 83% specificity for the prediction of progression to AD.93\"\n\nIt seems the context for isoprostanes is missing. But maybe earlier: \"Context for ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels:...\". Let's search: \"Context for ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels:\" appears once. After that, there is a block of text describing isoprostanes? Let's scroll: \"Context for ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels: 40 is the most prevalent form of Aβ in CSF – the Aβ42:40 ratio accounts for between-individual differences in Aβ isoforms.91 High tTau:Aβ42 and pTau:Aβ42 ratios predict future cognitive decline.93,94 A combined CSF biomarker test using Aβ42 and tTau has been reported to have 95% sensitivity and 83% specificity for the prediction of progression to AD.93\"\n\nThen after that, \"Context for ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels:...\". Actually the next lines: \"Context for ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels:...\". Then \"CSF – tau\" etc. This is confusing.\n\nMaybe the context for isoprostanes is not present. But the user expects us to treat it as a marker? The user says \"List to validate: ['RMCBC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist', 'ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels']\". They ask: \"Based STRICTLY on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to see if the documents mention isoprostanes as a marker. The context includes \"Context for ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels:\" but no further details. But maybe earlier there is a mention: \"Context for ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels:...\". Let's search for \"isoprostane\" in the context. The snippet shows \"Context for ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels: 40 is the most prevalent form of Aβ in CSF – the Aβ42:40 ratio accounts for between-individual differences in Aβ isoforms.91\". That seems wrong. But maybe the actual content is truncated. But we cannot assume beyond what is given. The only mention of isoprostanes is that phrase. It doesn't say it's a marker. But the phrase \"CSF isoprostane levels\" itself implies it's a biomarker. But the context doesn't confirm its validity. The user might expect us to mark it as valid because it's a biomarker. But we must rely solely on the documents. The documents mention isoprostanes but don't give evidence of their use as a marker. However, the phrase \"CSF isoprostane levels\" suggests it's a biomarker. But we need to interpret. The user says \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {valid:false}\". So we need to decide.\n\nGiven the context, the only mention of isoprostanes is in the heading \"Context for ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels:\" but no description. That alone might not be enough to claim it's a recognized marker. But the heading itself indicates it's a biomarker. The context might be incomplete. But the user instructs to base analysis exclusively on the evidence provided. Since the heading states \"CSF isoprostane levels\", that implies it's a biomarker. But we need more evidence? The heading is part of the context. So we can consider it a marker. The acronym: \"ISOPROSTANE\" is already given. But the acronym might be \"IsoP\"? But the context uses \"ISOPROSTANE\". So we will use \"ISOPROSTANE\".\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"RMCBC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"RMCBC\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"ISOPROSTANE\"}\n]\n\nBut we need to ensure JSON format exactly as required: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably produce array of objects. The system instructions: \"For each element, use this JSON structure: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": true/false, \"acronym\": \"ACR\" }\". So we produce an array of such objects. Ensure proper formatting.\n\nDouble-check: The user didn't specify array or separate objects. But typical answer: array of objects. We'll output as JSON array.\n\nAlso note: The user said \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\":..., \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\". So for RMCBC we should put \"acronym\":\"N/A\" or \"RMCBC\"? The instruction says if not valid, acronym \"N/A\". So we should set acronym \"N/A\". Good catch. So for RMCBC: valid=false, acronym=\"N/A\". For ISOPROSTANE: valid=true, acronym=?? The instruction says \"provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" The document uses \"ISOPROSTANE\". So acronym \"ISOPROSTANE\". So final output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"RMCBC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"ISOPROSTANE: CSF isoprostane levels\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"ISOPROSTANE\"}\n]\n\nCheck if any other acronyms appear: The document uses \"RMCBC\" for the checklist.

Also mention \"FDG PET\" as a biomarker. So yes, it's recognized. Acronym: FDG-PET or FDG PET. The document uses \"FDG PET\". It also says \"fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography\" abbreviation \"FDG-PET\". So we should output acronym \"FDG-PET\".\n\nSecond item: \"ADCS-CGIC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\".

But the user might still consider it a marker? The instruction: \"Determine if it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The context says ADCS-CGIC is used as an outcome measure, not a biomarker.

The user says \"list to validate: ['ADAS-Cog13: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13-item', 'TMT-A: Trail Making Test Part A']\". We need to decide validity.\n\nGiven the documents, ADAS-Cog-13 is definitely a recognized marker. TMT-A is not explicitly called a marker. It is an assessment tool. The user might expect it to be considered a marker? But the instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The documents mention TMT-A as an assessment tool used in clinical trials. It is correlated with cognitive decline. But is it a marker? Possibly yes, as a cognitive test used to evaluate AD progression. But the documents do not call it a biomarker. The user specifically says \"recognised marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention TMT-A as an assessment tool, but not as a biomarker. So I'd mark it as invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"Table 2A. A selection of assessment tools commonly used only in clinical trials or in both clinical trials and clinical practice\". Under \"Assessment type\" there's \"Cognitive\". Then \"Assessment tool\" lists \"ADAS-Cog-13/14\" etc. It doesn't list TMT-A. Wait earlier in the text, there is mention of \"Trail Making Test Part A\" but not in that table. Actually the snippet shows \"Context for TMT-A: Trail Making Test Part A:\" but not the full table. The snippet indicates TMT-A is discussed somewhere else. But the snippet says \"Context for TMT-A: Trail Making Test Part A: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". That's about a technology for measuring pTau-217. Not relevant. Another snippet: \"Context for TMT-A: Trail Making Test Part A: Citation: Gunes, S.; Aizawa, Y.; Sugashi, T.; Sugimoto, M.; Rodrigues, P.P. Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in the Current State: A Narrative Review.\" That seems like a review article referencing TMT-A. But again, not necessarily a biomarker.\n\nThus, we should mark TMT-A as invalid.\n\nAlso we need to provide acronym. For ADAS-Cog13, acronym: ADAS-Cog-13. For TMT-A, since invalid, acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nReturn JSON array with objects.\n\nLet's produce output accordingly.",

There's no explicit statement that CSF albumin quotient is a recognized AD biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nNow PLASMA Lp-PLA2 ACTIVITY: There are multiple contexts referencing plasma lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 activity.

It might be studied but not yet accepted. The instruction: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item determine if it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" So we need to look for statements like \"recognized marker\", \"correlated with AD\", \"validated\".\n\nFrom the context: For CSF albumin quotient, there's no direct mention of AD. For Lp-PLA2, there is mention of \"Plasma lipoprotein‑associated phospholipase A2 activity\" but no explicit validation. The context includes \"Plasma lipoprotein‑associated phospholipase A2 activity: Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports 7 (2023) 355–380\" but the abstract might mention \"low-sensitive plasma assays...\".

Let's examine the context.\n\nThe first part lists many measures: Digit Span Backward, Digit Symbol, etc. It says \"Digit Span Backward: Digit Span Backward test\" type not listed. It's under \"Measure name\". There's mention of \"Digit Span Backward test: Type not listed\". So it's a measure used in neuropsychological tests. But is it a recognized marker? The document seems to be about outcome measures for clinical trials, not necessarily biomarkers. The question: Are these considered markers? The context indicates that Digit Span Backward is a neuropsychological test, not a biomarker. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents do not present evidence that Digit Span Backward is a biomarker. It appears as a measure used in trials. So likely invalid.\n\nBut let's check if there is any mention of \"pTau-217\" etc. The second item: 'SMT: Sniff Magnitude Test'. There is mention of \"Sniff Magnitude Test\" in the context. It refers to a test measuring smell magnitude? The context includes \"Sniff Magnitude Test: ce not being affected by small variations...\". It mentions \"potential for a platform and the associated plasma test to be scaled up\". Wait, maybe \"Sniff Magnitude Test\" is a test for olfactory function? But the context also references \"plasma biomarkers\" like pTau-217, Aβ42/40, etc. The snippet: \"technology for the measurement of pTau-217.\" That is a plasma biomarker. But \"Sniff Magnitude Test\" might refer to a test for olfactory dysfunction, which is a symptom but not a biomarker. The context doesn't say it's a recognized marker. It just describes the test's robustness. No mention of it being a marker for Alzheimer's. So likely invalid too.\n\nHowever, we need to confirm if there's any mention of \"SMT\" abbreviation. The context shows \"SMT: Sniff Magnitude Test\" in the list. So the acronym would be \"SMT\".\n\nSimilarly, for Digit Span Backward, the acronym could be \"Digit Span Backward\" itself? But the user asks for the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For Digit Span Backward, perhaps \"DSB\"? Not sure. The document uses \"Digit Span Backward\" as the measure name. It doesn't give an acronym. So we might put \"N/A\" or maybe \"DSB\"? But the instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" If none, maybe \"N/A\". But the output requires \"acronym\": \"ACR\". If not valid, \"acronym\":\"N/A\". So for invalid markers, we set valid:false and acronym:\"N/A\". For valid ones, we set valid:true and acronym accordingly.\n\nThus both likely invalid. But double-check: Is there any mention that Digit Span Backward is a recognized marker? The context: \"Digit Span Backward: Digit Span Backward test: Type not listed\". Under \"Measure name\", \"Type of COAa\" maybe stands for \"Clinical Outcome Assessment\"? The table lists \"Measure name\" and \"Type of COAa\" and \"Disease severity\" columns. So Digit Span Backward is a measure used in clinical trials, but not necessarily a biomarker. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.

The context indicates that Digit Span Backward is a neuropsychological test, not a biomarker. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents do not present evidence that Digit Span Backward is a biomarker. It appears as a measure used in trials. So likely invalid.\n\nBut let's check if there is any mention of \"pTau-217\" etc. The second item: 'SMT: Sniff Magnitude Test'. There is mention of \"Sniff Magnitude Test\" in the context. It refers to a test measuring smell magnitude? The context includes \"Sniff Magnitude Test: ce not being affected by small variations...\". It mentions \"potential for a platform and the associated plasma test to be scaled up\". Wait, maybe \"Sniff Magnitude Test\" is a test for olfactory function? But the context also references \"plasma biomarkers\" like pTau-217, Aβ42/40, etc. The snippet: \"technology for the measurement of pTau-217.\" That is a plasma biomarker. But \"Sniff Magnitude Test\" might refer to a test for olfactory dysfunction, which is a symptom but not a biomarker. The context doesn't say it's a recognized marker. It just describes the test's robustness. No mention of it being a marker for Alzheimer's. So likely invalid too.\n\nHowever, we need to confirm if there's any mention of \"SMT\" abbreviation. The context shows \"SMT: Sniff Magnitude Test\" in the list. So the acronym would be \"SMT\".\n\nSimilarly, for Digit Span Backward, the acronym could be \"Digit Span Backward\" itself? But the user asks for the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For Digit Span Backward, perhaps \"DSB\"? Not sure. The document uses \"Digit Span Backward\" as the measure name. It doesn't give an acronym. So we might put \"N/A\" or maybe \"DSB\"? But the instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" If none, maybe \"N/A\". But the output requires \"acronym\": \"ACR\". If not valid, \"acronym\":\"N/A\". So for invalid markers, we set valid:false and acronym:\"N/A\". For valid ones, we set valid:true and acronym accordingly.\n\nThus both likely invalid. But double-check: Is there any mention that Digit Span Backward is a recognized marker? The context: \"Digit Span Backward: Digit Span Backward test: Type not listed\". Under \"Measure name\", \"Type of COAa\" maybe stands for \"Clinical Outcome Assessment\"? The table lists \"Measure name\" and \"Type of COAa\" and \"Disease severity\" columns. So Digit Span Backward is a measure used in clinical trials, but not necessarily a biomarker. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents don't say it's a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nFor SMT: Sniff Magnitude Test, again no mention of being a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines? The required response format: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably an array of objects. The system didn't specify array but examples show each element separately. We'll output an array.\n\nSo:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"Digit Span Backward: Digit Span Backward test\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"SMT: Sniff Magnitude Test\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nMake sure to follow exactly.",

So it's a recognized marker. Acronym: MMSE. The document shows \"Mini‑Mental State Examination\" and abbreviation \"MMSE\". So valid true.\n\nAIMS: Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Is it a marker for AD? The context includes mention of AIMS but seems more about measuring involuntary movements maybe in Parkinson's? But within AD context? Let's search context: There's mention of \"Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale\" under \"Context for AIMS: Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale\". It appears in tables listing endpoints. But is it a recognized marker for AD? The context says \"Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale\" but no explicit statement linking it to AD. However, the table lists many measures used in AD clinical trials, including AIMS? Let's see: In the table, there is \"AIMS: Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale\" listed among others like FAQ, CMAI, QoL-AD, etc. That suggests it's used as endpoint in AD trials. But is it a marker? It's a measurement tool, not a biological marker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" might refer to biomarker or measurement. The context indicates it's a measure used in AD trials. But is it validated as a marker? The text doesn't explicitly say it's a marker. The instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate...\". Based strictly on documents. The documents mention AIMS but do not describe its validity as a marker for AD. It may be used as an endpoint but not necessarily a marker.

In the context, there are multiple mentions: \"Context for rsfMRI: Resting State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (connectivity)\" appears several times. It seems to be a type of measure. But is it considered a recognized marker? The context includes mention of \"Resting State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (connectivity)\" but no explicit statement that it's a biomarker for AD. It's listed under \"Type of COAa\" maybe. The table lists measures like \"Digit Symbol\", etc. There's a column \"Type of COAa\". Not sure what COAa stands for. But rsfMRI is listed as \"Type not listed\"? Actually earlier: \"Context for rsfMRI: Resting State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (connectivity): Type not listed\". So it's a type of measurement but not listed as a recognized marker? The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The document says \"Resting State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (connectivity)\" is a type of measure. Is it recognized as a marker? There is no direct claim that it's a biomarker. It might be used as a biomarker but not explicitly stated. The context includes references to \"structural imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease: predicting disease progression\" and \"resting state functional connectivity\" but not necessarily a marker. The user likely expects that rsfMRI is a recognized biomarker. But we must rely solely on the documents. The documents mention rsfMRI but do not say it's a recognized marker. It just says \"Context for rsfMRI: Resting State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (connectivity): Type not listed\". That suggests it's not listed as a recognized marker. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nSecond, SUVR: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (PET amyloid). The context has many references to SUVR. It states \"Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (PET amyloid)\" and describes its usage. It says \"Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (PET amyloid)... expressed in standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr) and/or centiloid units.\" Also \"CSF Aβ markers... with AβPET\".

But since it's invalid, acronym can still be \"rsfMRI\" or \"N/A\"? The spec says: If not valid, set acronym:\"N/A\". So we set acronym \"N/A\".\n\nFor SUVR: original_name: 'SUVR: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (PET amyloid)'. Acronym: \"SUVR\".\n\nReturn JSON array. Ensure correct syntax.",

For example: \"Context for FLORBETAPIR PET: Florbetapir PET amyloid plaque detection: it has been able to distinguish abnormal from normal amyloid-positron emission tomography (A‑PET) scans...\" So yes, it's a recognized marker. Acronym? The document uses \"A‑PET\" for amyloid PET. But also \"PET\" stands for positron emission tomography. The specific marker is \"Florbetapir PET\". The abbreviation might be \"A‑PET\" or \"PET\". However, the question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For the first item, likely \"A‑PET\" or maybe \"PET\". Let's search context: \"A‑PET\" appears. Also \"Aβ\" etc. But for Florbetapir PET, they refer to \"A‑PET\" as general amyloid PET. The specific tracer is florbetapir. They don't give an acronym like \"FBP\" or something. So we can say acronym: \"A‑PET\".\n\nSecond item: \"FLORBETAPIR PET QUALITY: Florbetapir-PET Scan Quality\". Is this a recognized marker? It's about scan quality, not a biomarker itself. The context says \"Florbetapir-PET Scan Quality\" refers to quality assessment of the scan. That is not a biomarker. So we should mark it as invalid.

It's a PET tracer for amyloid imaging. Recognized marker. Acronym likely AV-45 or flutemetamol. But the question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For AV-45: flutemetamol, the abbreviation is AV-45. They might also call it flutemetamol.

    "cot": "We need to parse the given context. The user wants to analyze two items: 'NAA: N-acetylaspartate' and 'GLUTAMATE: Glutamate'. They want to see if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Must rely strictly on provided documents. Let's examine the context.\n\nThe context includes multiple paragraphs referencing NAA: N-acetylaspartate. It says: \"Context for NAA: N-acetylaspartate: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". Then later: \"Context for NAA: N-acetylaspartate: d a specificity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" Also earlier: \"These recent results demonstrate the plasma p‑tau assays’ ability to accurately diagnose AD...\". But we need to check if NAA is considered a recognized marker. There's mention: \"The NfL is a component of the neural cytoskeleton released after axonal damage.\" That is about NfL, not NAA. There is no explicit statement that NAA is a recognized biomarker for AD. However, there is mention of NAA being used in some context? Let's search the text: \"NAA\" appears only in the context lines. The first line: \"Context for NAA: N-acetylaspartate: res the awardee...\" Not clear. Another line: \"Context for NAA: N-acetylaspartate: d a specificity of 93.3%...\". So maybe it's part of a study showing NAA as a biomarker? But the excerpt doesn't explicitly say it's a biomarker for AD. It just mentions \"diagnose patients with AD\" but not specifying what marker. Could be referring to NAA? The sentence: \"Context for NAA: N-acetylaspartate: d a specificity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" That suggests NAA might be used to diagnose AD. But we need to confirm if the document states that NAA is a recognized marker. The phrase \"diagnose patients with AD\" implies yes. But we need to ensure that the context indeed refers to NAA as the marker. The preceding words: \"Context for NAA: N-acetylaspartate:\" then \"d a specificity of 93.3%\" etc. It's ambiguous but likely indicates that NAA is being discussed as a biomarker. So we can consider it valid.\n\nNow for GLUTAMATE: The context for GLUTAMATE: \"Glutamate: ns and delusions start, and after some years, it reaches a more aggressive stage.\" That's generic description of AD. No mention of glutamate as a biomarker. Later: \"Context for GLUTAMATE: Glutamate: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al. Tracking pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease: an updated hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers.\" That references a paper about dynamic biomarkers but not specifically glutamate. Further: \"Context for GLUTAMATE: Glutamate:... The need for additional drug- or class-specific safety biomarkers may arise with different drug targets/mechanisms.\" Again not specific. There's no direct mention that glutamate is a recognized biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut we need to produce JSON objects per item. For each, include original_name, valid boolean, acronym string. For invalid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nAlso note: The acronym for NAA is \"NAA\" presumably. For glutamate, the acronym would be \"GLU\"? But the question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For NAA, the abbreviation is \"NAA\". For glutamate, maybe \"GLUTAMATE\" itself? But the document uses \"GLUTAMATE: Glutamate\" as label. It doesn't give an acronym. So we might put \"N/A\" or maybe \"GLUTAMATE\" but that's not an abbreviation. The instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" If none, maybe \"N/A\". But for glutamate, the document uses \"GLUTAMATE\" as the heading. That could be considered the acronym. But the heading is \"GLUTAMATE: Glutamate\". So the acronym is \"GLUTAMATE\". But is that an abbreviation? It's the full word. But still it's the term used. I'd lean to \"GLUTAMATE\" as the acronym. But the instruction says \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For glutamate, there's no abbreviation like GLU. So we can set \"GLUTAMATE\". But if we think it's invalid, we still need to provide acronym field. For invalid, we set \"N/A\". The spec says: If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}.\n\nThus for glutamate, we set valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\".\n\nFor NAA, valid:true, acronym:\"NAA\".\n\nLet's double-check if the context definitely supports NAA as a biomarker. The snippet: \"Context for NAA: N-acetylaspartate: d a specificity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" That seems to refer to a study where NAA had high specificity and AUC for diagnosing AD. So yes, it's a recognized marker. So valid.\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects.\n\nMake sure formatting exactly as required: Each object separate? The instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {... }\". Probably return an array of objects. We'll output as JSON array.\n\nLet's craft final answer.",

We must determine if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. And provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly rely on the provided context. Let's review the context for each.\n\nFirst item: '1H MRS: Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy'.\n\nIn the context, we see references to \"1H MRS\" multiple times. It appears in the first paragraph: \"Context for 1H MRS: Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy\". Then later: \"Context for 1H MRS: Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy: ion processes.\" etc. There's mention of \"1H MRS\" as a technique. But is it considered a marker? The text says \"The next section introduces minimally invasive biomarkers.\" It doesn't explicitly say that 1H MRS is a marker. It's a spectroscopy technique used to measure metabolites. But the document might treat it as a biomarker? Let's read again: The first paragraph: \"Context for 1H MRS: Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property... A research award made to Washington University in St. Louis led to the development of technology for the measurement of pTau-217.\" That seems about measuring pTau-217 via 1H MRS? Actually pTau-217 measurement technology maybe uses mass spec? Wait: \"development of technology for the measurement of pTau-217\" - could be a new assay. But 1H MRS is a spectroscopy technique. The context indicates it's used for measuring pTau-217? Not sure.\n\nBut the question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The documents mention 1H MRS as a technique, not necessarily a marker. The term \"marker\" refers to something like a protein or metabolite measured. 1H MRS measures metabolites like NAA, choline, myoinositol, etc. But the context doesn't specify that 1H MRS itself is a marker. So likely it's not considered a marker. But we need to check if the documents refer to 1H MRS as a biomarker. Search for \"1H MRS\" usage: The first line: \"Context for 1H MRS: Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy: res the awardee...\" then \"Context for 1H MRS: Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy: ion processes.\" Then \"Context for 1H MRS: Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy: l Research Unit for Dementia...\" etc. No explicit statement that 1H MRS is a marker. So I'd consider it invalid.\n\nSecond item: 'Florbetapir-18F: tracer used in PET scans to assess amyloid-beta'.\n\nThe context includes many mentions of Florbetapir-18F. It is described as a tracer used in PET scans to assess amyloid-beta. It is definitely a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The acronym used: \"Florbetapir-18F\" is the name; the abbreviation used in the context: \"Florbetapir-18F\" itself. Also sometimes referred to as \"Amyvid™\" (brand). But the context lists \"Florbetapir-18F\" as the tracer. The acronym might be \"FBP\"? But the context doesn't mention FBP. It just uses \"Florbetapir-18F\". So the acronym would be \"Florbetapir-18F\".\n\nThus output JSON objects:\n\nFor 1H MRS: {\"original_name\":\"1H MRS: Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n\nFor Florbetapir-18F: {\"original_name\":\"Florbetapir-18F: tracer used in PET scans to assess amyloid-beta\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"Florbetapir-18F\"}.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines? The instruction: For each element, use this JSON structure. Probably produce an array of objects. But the instruction didn't specify array. It said \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" and gave example. Could produce separate JSON objects separated by newline. Usually they'd expect an array. I'll produce an array containing both objects.\n\nLet's craft final answer accordingly.",

If not valid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nWe must rely solely on the provided documents. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, ADAS-Cog 11: It's clearly a cognitive assessment scale used in AD trials. It is listed multiple times in the tables. For example, Table 1 lists ADAS-Cog-11 as a measure name. Also, the text says \"ADAS-Cog 11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 11-item\". So yes, it's a recognized marker? But is it considered a biomarker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" could refer to a biomarker or a clinical assessment tool. The context includes ADAS-Cog as an outcome measure, not necessarily a biomarker. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The ADAS-Cog is a cognitive test, not a biomarker. But the document refers to it as a measure used in trials. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention ADAS-Cog as a measure used in trials, but not necessarily as a biomarker. However, the context indicates that ADAS-Cog is used as a primary endpoint in many trials. That qualifies as a recognized marker for AD? Possibly yes, because it's used to assess disease severity. The user might consider it a marker. The instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate...\". So we need to decide if ADAS-Cog 11 is a recognized marker. The documents show it as a measure used in AD trials. So I'd say valid. Acronym: ADAS-Cog-11. Or maybe just ADAS-Cog-11. The abbreviation given: \"ADAS-Cog-11\". So acronym: ADAS-Cog-11.\n\nSecond, 'PR Interval: PR Interval'. The context mentions PR Interval in relation to a technology for measuring pTau-217. There's mention of \"PR Interval: PR Interval\" but seems like a placeholder. The context: \"PR Interval: PR Interval: res the awardee to share...\" etc. It doesn't seem to describe PR interval as a biomarker. It's likely not a recognized marker. So valid: false. Acronym: N/A.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"PR Interval: PR Interval\" repeated. It seems like a formatting artifact. No mention of PR interval being a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck required format: For each element, use JSON structure: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"...\"}.\n\nReturn as a JSON array? The instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" It didn't specify array, but typical would be separate objects. We'll output an array of objects.\n\nLet's craft final answer accordingly.",

The text says: \"Large variability in use... strongly reflects clinical trial outcomes and key features of AD; pre vs post change could be useful\" etc. It also says \"As it is measurable, it can show the level of decline, but it must be combined with amyloid biomarkers\". So maybe it's considered a marker? But we need to see if the document states that QTcF Interval is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's.

It's already called QTcF Interval. The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For QTcF Interval, the abbreviation would likely be \"QTcF\". For QRS Complex, abbreviation \"QRS\". Are these considered markers? The context doesn't explicitly say they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's. It might just mention them as part of some discussion. The instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So we need to decide validity based on evidence. The context references QTcF Interval multiple times, but does it say it's a recognized marker? It says \"Strongly reflects clinical trial outcomes and key features of AD; pre vs post change could be useful\". That suggests it's considered relevant. But is it recognized as a marker? The phrase \"marker\" appears earlier: \"potential plasma test to be scaled up... high throughput delivery of reliable results\". Not sure. The context also lists \"fluid-based and imaging biomarkers\" including Aβ, tau, etc. No mention of QTcF or QRS as biomarkers. The context for QRS Complex also repeats similar content. It seems the context may be generic, not specifically stating that QRS Complex is a biomarker. The user wants us to evaluate based on the documents. Since there is no explicit statement that QRS Complex is a recognized marker, we should mark it invalid. Similarly, QTcF Interval: There is mention that it \"strongly reflects clinical trial outcomes and key features of AD\", but not necessarily recognized as a biomarker. Might still be considered a marker? The context says \"It can show the level of decline, but it must be combined with amyloid biomarkers\". That implies it's a marker of decline? But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents do not explicitly label QTcF Interval as a biomarker. They talk about it as a measurement. I'd lean towards marking both as invalid because there's insufficient evidence that they are recognized markers. But let's double-check.\n\nSearch context: \"QTcF Interval:\" appears at top. It says \"Context for QTcF Interval: QTcF Interval: ce not being affected by small variations...\" etc. It continues: \"Reduced risk of misclassifying patient due to variance introduced in testing conditions.\" \"Scalability Potential for a platform and the associated plasma test to be scaled up to accommodate high volume testing.\" \"Enabling the high-throughput delivery of reliable results with a fast turnaround time.\" \"Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer’s disease; MCI, mild cognitive impairment.\" So it's describing a test platform. It doesn't call it a biomarker. Later: \"Large variability in use depending on practice patterns in that area / expertise. Strongly reflects clinical trial outcomes and key features of AD; pre vs post change could be useful. As it is measurable, it can show the level of decline, but it must be combined with amyloid biomarkers.\" So it's a measurement that can reflect decline but needs combination. That might qualify as a biomarker? The term \"biomarker\" is used elsewhere. But the context doesn't explicitly say \"QTcF Interval is a biomarker\". It says \"it can show the level of decline\". That might be enough? The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". Recognized marker means the documents identify it as a marker. The context does not explicitly say so. So I think we should mark as invalid.\n\nSimilarly for QRS Complex: The context for QRS Complex is basically same as for QTcF Interval, repeated. No explicit mention of QRS Complex as a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nThus produce two JSON objects:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"QTcF Interval: QTcF Interval\",\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n}\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"QRS Complex: QRS Complex\",\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n}\n\nBut the instruction: \"If a marker is not a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\"\n\nYes.\n\nReturn array?

It says \"Context for QTcF Interval: QTcF Interval: ce not being affected by small variations...\" etc. It continues: \"Reduced risk of misclassifying patient due to variance introduced in testing conditions.\" \"Scalability Potential for a platform and the associated plasma test to be scaled up to accommodate high volume testing.\" \"Enabling the high-throughput delivery of reliable results with a fast turnaround time.\" \"Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer’s disease; MCI, mild cognitive impairment.\" So it's describing a test platform. It doesn't call it a biomarker. Later: \"Large variability in use depending on practice patterns in that area / expertise. Strongly reflects clinical trial outcomes and key features of AD; pre vs post change could be useful. As it is measurable, it can show the level of decline, but it must be combined with amyloid biomarkers.\" So it's a measurement that can reflect decline but needs combination. That might qualify as a biomarker? The term \"biomarker\" is used elsewhere. But the context doesn't explicitly say \"QTcF Interval is a biomarker\". It says \"it can show the level of decline\". That might be enough? The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". Recognized marker means the documents identify it as a marker. The context does not explicitly say so. So I think we should mark as invalid.\n\nSimilarly for QRS Complex: The context for QRS Complex is basically same as for QTcF Interval, repeated. No explicit mention of QRS Complex as a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nThus produce two JSON objects:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"QTcF Interval: QTcF Interval\",\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n}\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"QRS Complex: QRS Complex\",\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n}\n\nBut the instruction: \"If a marker is not a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\"\n\nYes.\n\nReturn array? The system instructions didn't specify array but said \"for each element, use this JSON structure\". Could return separate lines? Usually they'd expect an array of objects. I'll output a JSON array containing those objects.\n\nLet's craft final answer accordingly.",

That suggests it's considered a marker. But is it recognized? The text says \"absolute neutrophil count\" is a biomarker. There's no mention of acronym beyond ANC. So likely valid.\n\nNow EOS: Eosinophils. There is mention: \"Context for EOS: Eosinophils: Citation: Gunes, S.;...

But maybe repeated incorrectly. Let's search: The snippet shows \"Context for EOS: Eosinophils: d a specificity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" That seems like a copy error. But still indicates eosinophils might be studied. However, we need to check if there's explicit mention that eosinophils are a marker. The context includes citations referencing eosinophils as biomarkers. But do they say it's validated? Not sure. The text: \"Gunes, S.; Aizawa, Y.; Sugashi, T.; Sugimoto, M.; Rodrigues, P.P. Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in the Current State: A Narrative Review.\" That review presumably covers various biomarkers, possibly including eosinophils. But the excerpt doesn't explicitly state that eosinophils are a marker. It just lists the paper title. Another snippet: \"Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports 7 (2023) 355–380\" - maybe a review article about plasma biomarkers. But again no direct statement.\n\nThus we need to decide if EOS is recognized marker per documents. The context does not provide evidence that eosinophils are a recognized marker. It only references papers that might discuss them. Without explicit mention, we should mark as invalid.\n\nBut we need to be careful: The user specifically asks: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So for EOS, we need to see if it's mentioned. It's mentioned in the context: \"Context for EOS: Eosinophils: Citation: Gunes, S.;...\" So yes, it's mentioned. But does it have sufficient evidence? The context does not give specific performance metrics or mention that eosinophils are a marker. So insufficient evidence. So mark as invalid.\n\nAlso we need to provide acronym. For ANC, acronym is ANC. For EOS, acronym is EOS. But if invalid, acronym is \"N/A\".\n\nLet's produce JSON array with objects.\n\nCheck required format: For each element, use JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"name as provided in the list\",\n  \"valid\": true/false,\n  \"acronym\": \"ACR\"\n}\n\nIf invalid: \"acronym\":\"N/A\".\n\nReturn array?

The context includes a review of plasma biomarkers. Monocytes might be discussed as a biomarker. There's also mention of \"Monocytes:... specificity of 93.3%\" which indicates diagnostic performance. So likely yes, monocytes are considered a marker.\n\nNow BASO: Basophils. The context for BASO: Basophils includes citations: \"Citation: Gunes, S.; Aizawa, Y.; Sugashi, T.; Sugimoto, M.; Rodrigues, P.P. Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in the Current State: A Narrative Review.\" Then there's discussion about basophils? The excerpt shows \"Basophils: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" Wait that's about basophils? Actually \"Basophils: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" Might be truncated. But overall, the context seems to discuss basophils as a biomarker? Not sure. The text mentions \"Baseline biomarker values can help identify participants with AD (diagnostic) or those likely to develop AD (susceptibility)...\". But no explicit mention of basophils as a biomarker. The context for BASO: Basophils appears to be about basophils but maybe not specifically as a marker. The snippet: \"Basophils: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That seems to refer to basophil counts? It's unclear. The rest of the context: \"Conclusion Biomarkers hold significant potential for enhancing and expediting the development of drugs for AD and related dementias.\" No direct statement that basophils are a recognized marker. The question: \"Based STRICTLY on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to produce JSON objects for each.\n\nFor MONO: Monocytes: Recognized marker? Yes, based on the context referencing specificity and AUC. Acronym: MONO? Or maybe \"Mono\"? The abbreviation given is MONO: Monocytes. So acronym is MONO. But maybe the most known abbreviation is \"Monocyte count\" or \"MO\"? But the context uses MONO. So we output \"acronym\":\"MONO\".\n\nFor BASO: Basophils: Is it recognized? The context does not clearly state basophils as a biomarker. There's mention of basophils in relation to ARIA risk, but not necessarily as a biomarker for AD. The instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So we mark BASO as invalid. Acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nBut check if there is any mention of basophils as a biomarker. The context: \"Basophils: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That might suggest basophils as a safety biomarker? But still not clear. The context also says \"Baseline biomarker values can help identify participants with AD (diagnostic) or those likely to develop AD (susceptibility)\". But not specific to basophils. The context for BASO: Basophils includes a narrative review of biomarkers for AD. Could include basophils among them? But the excerpt doesn't show that. Without explicit mention, we consider insufficient evidence.\n\nThus produce JSON array? The required format: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably separate objects. The user didn't specify array but likely expects array of objects. We'll output a JSON array.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"MONO: Monocytes\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"MONO\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"BASO: Basophils\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object keys exactly as specified. Use boolean true/false. Good.\n\nReturn.",

They want to see if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly rely on the provided context. Let's examine the context for mentions of lymphocytes and blood urea nitrogen.\n\nFrom the context: There are multiple sections referencing \"LYMPH: Lymphocytes\" but it's unclear whether lymphocytes are considered a marker. The text says: \"Context for LYMPH: Lymphocytes: d a speciﬁcity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" That suggests lymphocyte count or some lymphocyte metric might be used as a biomarker? It says \"Lymphocytes: d a specificity of 93.3%\" etc. But is that a recognized marker? It's presented as a biomarker. So maybe yes.\n\nBut we need to check if the document explicitly states that lymphocytes are a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The phrase \"Lymphocytes: d a specificity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82]\" indicates that lymphocytes are used as a biomarker. So we can consider it valid.\n\nNow BUN: Blood Urea Nitrogen. The context includes \"Context for BUN: Blood Urea Nitrogen:\" and then various paragraphs. There's mention of \"Blood Urea Nitrogen: ance as evidence evolves.\" Not sure. But there is no explicit statement that BUN is a marker for Alzheimer's. The context seems to talk about BUN as part of biomarker profiling but not necessarily as a specific marker. The text: \"Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". Then later: \"Blood Urea Nitrogen:...\". But I don't see a direct claim that BUN is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. It appears to be just a variable in a study. So likely invalid.\n\nAlso the acronym: For lymphocytes, the acronym could be \"LYMPH\" as given. For BUN, the acronym is \"BUN\".\n\nThus output JSON array with objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object should contain original_name, valid, acronym.

    "cot": "We need to parse the context. The user wants to validate two items: 'K: Potassium' and 'Cl: Chloride'. They want to see if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Must rely only on provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nThe context includes multiple references about plasma biomarkers like p-tau181, etc. It also mentions potassium and chloride but likely as electrolytes? There's mention of \"Potassium: rkers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials.\" That seems like a title referencing potassium as a marker? But we need to check if it's recognized as a marker. The context says \"Context for K: Potassium: rkers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials. Lancet Neurol 21, 726-734.\" That appears to be a paper titled \"Markers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation...\" maybe truncated. Actually \"Potassium\" might be part of the title? Wait: \"Context for K: Potassium: rkers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials.\" Could be \"Potassium: markers in Alzheimer’s disease\"? Might be a formatting error. But the document indicates potassium is considered as a marker? Not sure.\n\nAlso there is \"Context for K: Potassium: ce not being affected by small variations...\". So they talk about potassium's stability. They mention \"Potential for a platform and the associated plasma test to be scaled up to accommodate high volume testing.\" So they treat potassium as a candidate biomarker.\n\nBut do they provide evidence that potassium is a recognized marker? The context doesn't explicitly say that potassium is a recognized biomarker for AD. It just says \"Context for K: Potassium:...\". There is no mention of correlation with AD pathology. It's ambiguous.\n\nSimilarly for chloride: \"Context for Cl: Chloride: The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease 12 (2025) 100056...\" They discuss chloride but again no explicit mention of correlation with AD. They talk about \"Chloride: ce not being affected by small variations...\".\n\nThus, based solely on the provided context, we cannot confirm that potassium or chloride are recognized markers for AD. The context does not provide evidence linking them to AD. Therefore, both should be marked as invalid.\n\nHowever, we need to consider if the context includes any mention of potassium or chloride as biomarkers. The first line: \"Context for K: Potassium: rkers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials.\" That could be a truncated phrase \"Markers in Alzheimer’s disease\". Maybe the word \"Potassium\" is part of the title incorrectly inserted. But the phrase \"Potassium: rkers\" suggests something missing. Possibly the original title: \"Potassium: markers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials.\" That would mean potassium is indeed a marker. But the context is incomplete. But still, the presence of a paper titled \"Potassium: markers in Alzheimer’s disease\" implies that potassium is studied as a marker. But is it recognized? The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The document references a study about potassium as a marker. That suggests recognition. But we need to decide.\n\nLet's search within context for \"potassium\" usage. The text: \"Context for K: Potassium: rkers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials. Lancet Neurol 21, 726-734.\" That's the only mention. No other mention of potassium elsewhere. So the only evidence is that there's a paper about potassium as a marker. That might be enough to say it's a recognized marker per documents. But the instruction: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nSo we need to find the acronym used. For potassium, the abbreviation is \"K\". For chloride, \"Cl\". Those are chemical symbols. Are those the acronyms used? The context uses \"K:\" and \"Cl:\" preceding the names. So yes, the acronym is K and Cl.\n\nBut we need to verify if the documents mention any other acronym for potassium or chloride. None else. So we can use \"K\" and \"Cl\".\n\nNow validity: For potassium, the existence of a paper titled \"Potassium: markers in Alzheimer’s disease\" suggests it's a marker. But is it recognized? The paper is in Lancet Neurology, which is reputable. So I'd say yes, it's recognized. For chloride, no such evidence. So invalid.\n\nAlternatively, we could interpret that the context does not provide evidence that chloride is a marker. So invalid.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"K: Potassium\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"K\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"Cl: Chloride\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nBut we need to ensure JSON format exactly as required: Each object separate? The spec says \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {... }\". Probably produce array of objects. We'll produce array.\n\nCheck if we need to include quotes around keys. Yes.\n\nReturn array.\n\nLet's craft final answer.",

So likely invalid too.\n\nThus both invalid. Acronym: For ALT, the acronym is ALT itself. For Bilirubin, acronym is Bil. But we need to provide \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For ALT, the document uses \"ALT: Alanine Aminotransferase\". So acronym is ALT. For Bilirubin, the document uses \"Bil: Bilirubin\". So acronym is Bil. However, if invalid, we set acronym to \"N/A\".\n\nBut the instruction: If element is NOT a valid marker, indicate acronym \"N/A\". So we don't give ALT or Bil. So output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"ALT: Alanine Aminotransferase\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"Bil: Bilirubin\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck if any mention of ALT as a marker? The context says \"Baseline biomarker values can help identify participants with AD...\". But earlier: \"ALT: Alanine Aminotransferase: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That suggests ALT is a safety biomarker, not a diagnostic marker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". Safety biomarker might still be considered a marker? But the context indicates it's a safety biomarker for drug toxicity, not a disease biomarker. The question likely expects that ALT is not a recognized AD biomarker. Similarly Bilirubin not mentioned.\n\nThus produce JSON array.",

    "cot": "We need to parse the context. The user wants to validate two items: 'AlkPhos: Alkaline Phosphatase' and 'UA: Uric Acid'. They want to see if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Must rely strictly on provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst paragraph: \"Context for AlkPhos: Alkaline Phosphatase: d a speciﬁcity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" So there is mention of AlkPhos being used as a marker? It says \"Alkaline Phosphatase: d a specificity of 93.3%...\". That suggests it's considered a marker. But we need to confirm if it's recognized as a marker for Alzheimer's. The context indicates that AlkPhos is a biomarker studied for AD. There's also mention of \"Other promising biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease\" etc. So yes, AlkPhos appears to be considered a marker.\n\nNow UA: Uric Acid. There is mention: \"Context for UA: Uric Acid: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum.\" Also later: \"Context for UA: Uric Acid: ne (cognitively unimpaired, MCI, or clinical dementia) [96].\" And earlier: \"Context for UA: Uric Acid: d a speciﬁcity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" Wait that's same as AlkPhos? Actually the text seems repeated. Might be confusion. But there is mention of UA: Uric Acid but not clear if it's a marker. Let's search context: \"Uric Acid\" appears only in the lines about \"Context for UA: Uric Acid: Biomarker profiles...\" and \"Context for UA: Uric Acid: ne (cognitively unimpaired...)\" and \"Context for UA: Uric Acid: d a specificity of 93.3%\" which might be mis-copied. But likely UA is not a recognized marker per se. The context doesn't provide evidence that uric acid is a marker for AD. It just mentions biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration. No direct mention of uric acid as a marker. So we should mark UA as invalid.\n\nBut we need to check if there's any mention of UA as a marker. The phrase \"Uric Acid: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\" could imply that uric acid is part of such profiles? Not necessarily. It's ambiguous. But the instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So we need to decide if UA is sufficiently evidenced. The context includes \"Context for UA: Uric Acid: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". That sentence alone doesn't say UA is a marker. It just says biomarker profiles combine amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration. It doesn't mention uric acid specifically. So I'd consider UA not validated.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"AlkPhos: Alkaline Phosphatase\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"AlkPhos\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"UA: Uric Acid\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nBut we need to ensure acronym matches what is used in documents. For AlkPhos, the document uses \"AlkPhos: Alkaline Phosphatase\". So acronym is \"AlkPhos\". For UA, no acronym used. So \"N/A\".\n\nReturn JSON array? The spec says \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" So maybe produce separate objects. Could output array of objects. I'll output array.\n\nLet's craft final.",

The context says: \"Context for Folate: Folate: and PP patients were identified by the metabolite markers glucosylgalactosyl, hydroxylysine—H2O, and Glutamine-carnitine...\". It mentions \"Folate\" but seems like it's part of a heading. There's mention of \"folate\" maybe as a marker? But reading: \"Context for Folate: Folate: and PP patients were identified by the metabolite markers...\" That seems incomplete. It might refer to \"Folate\" as a marker? However, later there is mention: \"Context for Folate: Folate: d a specificity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" So yes, folate appears to be considered a marker. Also earlier: \"Context for Folate: Folate: and PP patients were identified by the metabolite markers...\". So likely folate is being studied as a biomarker. So we should say valid: true. Acronym: \"Fol\"? But the document uses \"Folate\" itself. They didn't give an abbreviation. Maybe \"FOL\"? But the instruction: provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. The documents don't show an acronym for folate. So maybe \"N/A\"? But the requirement: If not a valid marker, set acronym \"N/A\". But here it's valid, so we need an acronym. Since none given, maybe just \"Folate\" itself? But they want acronym. Could use \"FOL\". But not present. Might choose \"FOLATE\" as full name. But better to put \"FOL\" or \"FOLATE\". I'd go with \"FOL\" as common abbreviation. But not sure. The instruction: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" There is no mention. So maybe \"N/A\" still? But then would conflict with valid flag.

It appears in multiple places: \"FCSRT (Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test)\" and \"FCSRT-FR: Free & Cued Selective Reminding Test – Free Recall\". The context says it's a neuropsychological test battery used for measuring memory. It's listed as a performance outcome measure (PerfO). So yes, it's a recognized marker? But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" meaning biomarker? However the context lists it as a measurement tool, not a biological marker. But the instruction: \"Your task is to analyze a list of potential markers extracted from datasets and validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" They want to check if each element is actually a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's. The context includes many tests but not necessarily biomarkers. But the question: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate...\". So we need to decide if FCSRT-FR qualifies as a marker. The context shows it's used as a cognitive test, part of PACC5 composite, used in clinical trials. It is a validated measure for AD progression. So likely considered a marker. The acronym: FCSRT. The full name given: Free & Cued Selective Reminding Test – Free Recall. The abbreviation: FCSRT. So valid: true, acronym: FCSRT.\n\nNow AQS: Attention Questionnaire Scores. Does the context mention AQS? I see \"AQS: Attention Questionnaire Scores\" appears only in the list at the end: \"Context for AQS: Attention Questionnaire Scores:\" but no further details.

Let's examine the context.\n\nThe context includes many references about MMSE, MoCA, etc. There's mention of MMSE as a performance outcome measuring severity of cognitive impairment, used in inclusion criteria for AD clinical trials. It's considered accurate for moderate stages of dementia. So yes, it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The acronym is MMSE. The document uses \"Mini Mental State Examination\" and abbreviation \"MMSE\". So valid = true, acronym = \"MMSE\".\n\nNow for BI: Burden Interview. The context mentions \"Burden Interview\" but let's search. There is mention of \"BI: Burden Interview\" in the list to validate. But within the context, there is no explicit mention of \"Burden Interview\" as a biomarker. The context includes \"BI: Burden Interview\" maybe referencing \"BI\" as abbreviation. However, the context includes \"BI: Burden Interview\" in the list to validate. But do the documents mention \"Burden Interview\"?

That seems like a snippet of a grant or something. Then later there's \"Context for BI: Burden Interview: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al.\" That appears to be a citation. And then \"Context for BI: Burden Interview: Citation: Gunes, S.; Aizawa, Y.; Sugashi, T.; Sugimoto, M.; Rodrigues, P.P.

The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". Does the context mention that Burden Interview is a recognized marker? Not obviously. The Burden Interview might refer to a caregiver burden measure, not a biomarker. The context may not support it being a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut we should check if any mention of \"BI\" as abbreviation for \"Burden Interview\" appears elsewhere. The context shows \"BI: Burden Interview\" repeated. But no description of it as a biomarker. The context also includes \"BI: Burden Interview\" in the list to validate. But the instruction says: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So we need to decide if there's enough evidence that Burden Interview is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The context does not describe it as such. It just lists it as a term. So we mark it invalid.\n\nAlso we need to provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For Burden Interview, the acronym is \"BI\". But since it's invalid, we still need to output \"acronym\":\"N/A\" per spec. Wait spec: If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {\"original_name\":\"name as provided\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}.\n\nThus for Burden Interview, we output acronym \"N/A\".\n\nDouble-check: The spec says: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {...

They want us to analyze the list ['AUC: Area Under the Concentration Time Curve (of Solanezumab)', 'NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory'] based strictly on the provided documents. For each element, we need to output JSON with original_name, valid boolean, and acronym. Must be based solely on evidence in documents. So we need to see if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's per documents.\n\nLet's examine the context. There's mention of AUC: Area Under the Concentration Time Curve (of Solanezumab). It appears in the document context: \"Context for AUC: Area Under the Concentration Time Curve (of Solanezumab): riers are at greater risk...\" etc. It's about pharmacokinetics of Solanezumab, an anti-Aβ therapy. But is AUC itself a biomarker? The context says \"Area Under the Concentration Time Curve (of Solanezumab)\" is a measure. However, the question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The documents talk about biomarkers like CSF amyloid beta, tau, imaging, etc. AUC is not listed among recognized biomarkers. It might be a pharmacodynamic measure rather than a disease biomarker. The context mentions \"additional drug- or class-specific safety biomarkers\" and \"baseline biomarker values can help identify participants\". But AUC is not described as a biomarker for AD. It's a PK metric. So likely it's not a recognized marker for AD. So valid = false.\n\nBut we need to check if there is any mention that AUC is used as a biomarker. The text: \"Context for AUC: Area Under the Concentration Time Curve (of Solanezumab): riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That seems to refer to risk of ARIA. But still not a biomarker for AD. So invalid.\n\nNow NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory. The context includes many references to NPI as a measure. It is used as an outcome measure, not necessarily a biomarker. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context lists NPI under \"Type of COAa\" maybe \"ClinRO\"? Actually NPI is a behavioral inventory measuring neuropsychiatric symptoms. Is it considered a biomarker? Usually biomarkers are biological measures. NPI is a clinical rating scale. The documents categorize it as \"ClinRO\" (clinician-rated outcome). But the question: \"marker for Alzheimer's\" might include clinical scales? The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The NPI is used to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD. It is indeed a tool used in AD research. But is it considered a biomarker? The context shows NPI as part of Table 1: \"Measure name\", \"Type of COAa\", \"Disease severity\", etc. It is used as an outcome measure. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention NPI as a measure used in AD trials. It is not a biomarker per se, but it's a validated instrument for assessing neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD. The question might consider it a marker because it's used to evaluate disease severity. But the definition of biomarker: \"biological marker\" vs \"clinical rating scale\". The context uses \"biomarker\" for things like CSF, imaging, etc. But NPI is not a biomarker. However, the user specifically asks to validate \"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\". The context includes NPI as a measure. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents show NPI is used in AD trials. But is it considered a biomarker? The context says \"Table 1: Contexts of use of biomarkers for AD clinical trials.\" Then lists many measures including NPI. But earlier they defined contexts of use of biomarkers. But NPI is a clinical outcome measure, not a biomarker. But the table includes it anyway. The question might treat it as a marker. Let's read the relevant excerpt:\n\n\"Context for NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory: Type not listed Digit Symbol; Digit Span Forward/Backward;...\"\n\nThen later: \"Table 1: Contexts of use of biomarkers for AD clinical trials.\"\n\nIt lists many measures: ADAS-Cog, ADCOMS, ADCS-ADL, ADCS-CGIC, A-IADL, CDR-SB, CFI, CSF, C-SSRS, DAD, EQ-5D-5L, FAQ, iADRS, MMSE, MRI, NPI-Q, etc.\n\nSo NPI is included. But the table's heading: \"Measure name\" \"Type of COAa\" \"Disease severity\" etc. So NPI is a measure used in AD trials. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". I'd say yes, NPI is recognized as a measure used in AD. But is it a biomarker? The context doesn't explicitly call it a biomarker. But the table is about contexts of use of biomarkers. So maybe they consider it a biomarker. But the user wants \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory, abbreviation is NPI. That's already given. So acronym: NPI.\n\nThus for NPI, valid = true. For AUC, valid = false.\n\nDouble-check if there's any mention of AUC being used as a biomarker. The context: \"Context for AUC: Area Under the Concentration Time Curve (of Solanezumab): riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That suggests AUC is used to predict risk of ARIA. But ARIA is a side effect. Not a disease biomarker. So not a marker for AD. So invalid.\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate line? The required format: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably output an array of objects. The system instructions: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" then shows object. So we can output an array of objects. Ensure proper JSON.\n\nThus final answer: [\n {\"original_name\":\"AUC: Area Under the Concentration Time Curve (of Solanezumab)\", \"valid\":false, \"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"NPI\"}\n]\n\nMake sure spacing consistent. Use double quotes. No trailing commas.",

    },
    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want us to analyze the list of potential Alzheimer's markers and validate them using the information contained in the provided documents. The list contains two items:\n\n1. 'Florbetapir PET: Florbetapir Positron Emission Tomography Scan'\n2. \"ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 11 Item Subscore\"\n\nWe need to check if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only the information provided in the context above. We cannot bring outside knowledge.\n\nLet's examine the context for Florbetapir PET. There are multiple references about Florbetapir PET. It says \"Florbetapir Positron Emission Tomography Scan\" and mentions that it can distinguish abnormal from normal amyloid-PET scans with gradually increasing accuracy. It also mentions plasma Aβ quantification etc. So yes, Florbetapir PET is a recognized biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. The acronym likely is \"Florbetapir PET\" or maybe \"Aβ-PET\". But we should look for the abbreviation used in the document. The text uses \"Florbetapir PET\" and \"Aβ-PET\". The first line: \"Florbetapir Positron Emission Tomography Scan: framework.\" Then later: \"Florbetapir Positron Emission Tomography Scan: it has been able to distinguish abnormal from normal amyloid-­ positron emission tomography (A­-PET) scans...\" So the abbreviation used is \"A‑PET\" for amyloid PET. But the marker itself is \"Florbetapir PET\". The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For Florbetapir PET, the abbreviation could be \"Florbetapir PET\" itself? Or \"Aβ-PET\"? Let's see what the document uses. The phrase \"Florbetapir Positron Emission Tomography Scan\" is repeated. The abbreviation \"A‑PET\" is used for amyloid PET. But the specific marker is Florbetapir PET. The abbreviation might be \"Florbetapir PET\" or \"Aβ-PET\". Which is more appropriate? The instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" So we should pick the abbreviation that appears in the documents. The document uses \"Florbetapir PET\" as the term. It also uses \"A‑PET\" as abbreviation for amyloid PET. But the marker is specifically Florbetapir PET. I'd say the abbreviation is \"Florbetapir PET\".\n\nNow for ADAS-Cog11. The context includes many references to ADAS-Cog-11, ADAS-Cog-13, etc. The abbreviation used is \"ADAS-Cog-11\" or \"ADAS-Cog11\". The document uses \"ADAS-Cog-11\" in tables. The list item is \"ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 11 Item Subscore\". So the abbreviation is \"ADAS-Cog-11\" or \"ADAS-Cog11\". The document uses \"ADAS-Cog-11\" in tables. So we will use \"ADAS-Cog-11\".\n\nBut we need to decide whether ADAS-Cog-11 is considered a recognized marker for Alzheimer's disease. It's a cognitive assessment scale, not a biomarker. However, the context indicates it's used as an endpoint in clinical trials. Is it considered a marker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention ADAS-Cog-11 as a measurement tool used in clinical trials. It may be considered a clinical outcome measure rather than a biomarker. But the user wants to know if it's a recognized marker. According to the documents, ADAS-Cog-11 is used as an outcome measure, not necessarily a biomarker. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents refer to ADAS-Cog-11 as a measurement tool used in clinical trials. That qualifies as a marker? Usually biomarkers are biological measures. ADAS-Cog-11 is a cognitive test, not a biomarker. But the context includes \"List of outcome measures assessed\" and \"Measures used in clinical trials\". The user might consider it a marker. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The context says \"ADCs-Cog-11\" is a measurement tool. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents do not explicitly state that ADAS-Cog-11 is a biomarker. It is a clinical assessment. But the user might still treat it as a marker. However, the instruction says \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate...\". So we need to decide if ADAS-Cog-11 is a valid marker. Based on the documents, ADAS-Cog-11 is used as an outcome measure, but not described as a biomarker. The user might expect it to be considered a marker because it's used in trials. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The context doesn't call it a biomarker. So we might mark it as invalid. But let's read the context again: There's a section \"Context for ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 11 Item Subscore:...\" It lists various contexts. It says \"ADAS-Cog-11\" is used as a measure. It is part of \"Outcome measures assessed\". It is used in clinical trials. But is it a biomarker? No. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"Florbetapir PET: Florbetapir Positron Emission Tomography Scan\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"Florbetapir PET\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 11 Item Subscore\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nMake sure JSON array.

It is indeed a biomarker. So valid. Acronym: 18F-AV-1451 itself is the tracer name. But the abbreviation might be AV-1451 or flortaucipir. The document uses \"18F-AV-1451\" as the tracer. So acronym: 18F-AV-1451. Or maybe \"AV-1451\". The instruction: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For ADCS-CGIC, the acronym is ADCS-CGIC.

The list contains two items: 'MacroHem: Cerebral Macrohemorrhage' and 'WBV: Whole Brain Volume'.\n\nWe need to check if these are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide acronym used in documents.\n\nFrom context: There is mention of MacroHem: Cerebral Macrohemorrhage. It appears in the document context but is it considered a marker? Let's search text: \"MacroHem\" appears at top: \"Context for MacroHem: Cerebral Macrohemorrhage:...\". But is macrohemorrhage a biomarker? The context says \"Cerebral Macrohemorrhage: ance as evidence evolves.\" Not clear. There's no explicit statement that macrohemorrhage is a biomarker for AD. It's more like a complication or imaging finding. So likely not a recognized marker per documents.\n\nNext, WBV: Whole Brain Volume. The context includes \"Whole Brain Volume: ce not being affected...\" etc. It mentions whole brain volume as a measure. Is it a recognized marker? The context indicates it's a measurement used in studies. For example, \"Whole Brain Volume: Potential for a platform...\". Also references to \"Whole Brain Volume\" in some citations. But is it validated as a marker? The context suggests it's a biomarker candidate. But we need to see if the documents mention it as a marker for AD. The context includes \"Whole Brain Volume:...\". It might be used as a biomarker. The question: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to decide validity.\n\nLet's examine the context for WBV: It says \"Whole Brain Volume: ce not being affected by small variations introduced through pre-analytical, analytical, batch-to-batch, and lot-to-lot variability. Reduced risk of misclassifying patient due to variance introduced in testing conditions. Scalability Potential for a platform and the associated plasma test to be scaled up to accommodate high volume testing. Enabling the high-throughput delivery of reliable results with a fast turnaround time. Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer’s disease; MCI, mild cognitive impairment....\"\n\nIt also references \"Whole Brain Volume\" in other contexts: \"Whole Brain Volume: adigm for advancing from discovery to clinic.\" And \"Whole Brain Volume:...\".\n\nBut is there a specific acronym? The abbreviation given is \"WBV\"? Actually the list uses \"WBV: Whole Brain Volume\". The context doesn't explicitly give an acronym. But maybe \"WBV\" stands for Whole Brain Volume. The context shows \"WBV: Whole Brain Volume\" as part of the list. The context itself refers to \"WBV: Whole Brain Volume\" earlier? Let's search: The context snippet: \"Context for WBV: Whole Brain Volume: ce not being aﬀected by small variations introduced through pre-analytical, analytical, batch-to-batch, and lot-to-lot variability.\" So yes, they refer to \"WBV: Whole Brain Volume\". So the acronym is WBV.\n\nNow, is Whole Brain Volume recognized as a marker? The context seems to treat it as a biomarker. It says \"Whole Brain Volume:... potential for a platform and the associated plasma test to be scaled up to accommodate high volume testing.\" That implies it's a biomarker. But is it specifically recognized for AD? The context includes references to \"Whole Brain Volume\" in relation to AD. For instance, \"Whole Brain Volume: adigm for advancing from discovery to clinic.\" Also \"Whole Brain Volume:...\". So likely yes, it's considered a biomarker.\n\nHowever, we should confirm if there's any mention that it's a recognized marker. The context includes \"Whole Brain Volume:...\". It also references \"Whole Brain Volume\" in the context of \"biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease\". The context includes many references to plasma biomarkers, but not necessarily whole brain volume. But the presence of \"Whole Brain Volume\" in the context suggests it's considered a biomarker.\n\nGiven the instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So we need to evaluate whether the context provides enough evidence that Whole Brain Volume is a recognized marker. The context states \"Whole Brain Volume:...\". It also references \"Whole Brain Volume\" in multiple places. It seems to be used as a biomarker. So I'd say it's valid.\n\nFor MacroHem: Cerebral Macrohemorrhage, the context only mentions it as a term but not as a biomarker. There's no evidence that macrohemorrhage is a recognized marker. So invalid.\n\nThus produce JSON array with objects.\n\nNeed to follow required format: For each element, use JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"name as provided in the list\",\n  \"valid\": true/false,\n  \"acronym\": \"ACR\"\n}\n\nIf invalid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nSo output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"MacroHem: Cerebral Macrohemorrhage\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"WBV: Whole Brain Volume\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"WBV\"}\n]\n\nMake sure formatting correct.",

So we need to see whether \"AB: Amyloid Burden\" appears as a marker. In the context, there is mention of \"Amyloid Burden\" as a concept, but is it a marker? The context says: \"Context for AB: Amyloid Burden:... The panel prioritized BBMs most commonly used as indicators of brain amyloid, excluding markers like glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL).\" Also mentions \"p-tau species\", \"CSF AD biomarkers\", \"amyloid PET\". But \"Amyloid Burden\" itself might refer to a measurement of amyloid deposition. Is it a marker? It's a conceptual term. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents talk about amyloid burden as a concept measured by various biomarkers. But is \"AB: Amyloid Burden\" itself a marker? Might be considered a marker category. The context uses \"AB: Amyloid Burden\" as a heading. It seems to be a category of biomarkers. The question likely expects that \"AB: Amyloid Burden\" is a recognized marker. And the acronym would be \"AB\".\n\nSimilarly, \"EF: Executive Function\" refers to a domain of cognitive testing, not a biomarker per se. The context lists many executive function tests, but \"Executive Function\" is not a biomarker. It's a cognitive domain. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" I think it's not a biomarker. So valid = false. Acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nBut maybe the context includes \"EF: Executive Function\" as a heading for tests measuring executive function. But the question: \"marker for Alzheimer's\" - executive function deficits are a symptom, not a biomarker.

So we need to see whether Florbetapir tracer is considered a marker. The context includes references: \"Context for FBP: Florbetapir tracer: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al. Tracking pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease...\" Also mention \"Florbetapir tracer\" multiple times. It seems it's a PET imaging tracer used to detect amyloid plaques. It's a biomarker. So yes, it's recognized. Acronym? The document uses \"FBP\". That stands for Florbetapir tracer. But maybe the abbreviation is \"FBP\"? Actually the list item itself says 'FBP: Florbetapir tracer'. So the acronym is FBP. But we should confirm if there is another acronym like \"Florbetapir\" sometimes called \"Amyvid\" but that's not in context. The context shows \"FBP: Florbetapir tracer\". So we can say acronym \"FBP\".\n\nNow second: 'STROOP: Stroop Test'. Is Stroop Test a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context mentions Stroop Test in relation to measuring pTau-217? Wait reading: There's a section \"Context for STROOP: Stroop Test:...\". It appears to talk about a technology for measurement of pTau-217, licensed to C2N Diagnostics. But the Stroop Test is a cognitive test, not a biomarker. The context might mention Stroop Test as part of a study but not as a biomarker. Let's search the context: There is \"Context for STROOP: Stroop Test: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". It refers to technology for measurement of pTau-217. The Stroop Test is a cognitive test used to measure executive function. Not a biomarker. The question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" Likely no. The documents don't present Stroop Test as a biomarker. So we mark invalid. Acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nBut we need to check if there's any mention of Stroop Test being used as a biomarker. The context includes \"Context for STROOP: Stroop Test:...\". It doesn't say it's a biomarker. It just describes some product insert for a test kit for pTau-217. The Stroop Test is referenced as a name of the context but not as a biomarker.

The document uses \"ADAS-Cog-11\", \"ADAS-Cog-13\", etc. The abbreviation is ADAS-Cog. So we would say valid: true, acronym: ADAS-Cog.\n\nNow EXAMINER: NIH EXAMINER Computer Battery. The context includes mention of \"NIH EXAMINER Computer Battery\" as part of a table of assessment tools. It lists various tests like Digit Symbol, Digit Span, etc. It seems to be a battery of neuropsychological tests. Is it a recognized marker? The context says \"NEUROLOGICAL TEST BATT...\". It might be considered a cognitive assessment tool. But is it a marker? The context doesn't explicitly state that EXAMINER is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. It just mentions it as an assessment tool. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents mention EXAMINER as a computer battery used in assessments. There's no explicit statement that it's a marker. But maybe it's used as a marker? The context shows \"NIH EXAMINER Computer Battery\" under \"Table 1 continued\" with \"Measure name\" and \"Type of COAa\" etc. It lists \"Digit Symbol; Digit Span Forward/Backward; Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Digit ordering (span), Digit Span PerfO\". That suggests it's a cognitive test battery. It might be used as a marker. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents don't explicitly call it a marker. They treat it as an assessment tool. But the user wants to know if it's a recognized marker. I'd lean that it's not explicitly validated as a marker in the documents. So we could mark it as invalid. But let's double-check.\n\nSearch context for \"EXAMINER\" occurrences. The text includes:\n\n\"Context for EXAMINER: NIH EXAMINER Computer Battery: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellec-tual-property...\"\n\nThen later: \"Context for EXAMINER: NIH EXAMINER Computer Battery: Type not listed Digit Symbol; Digit Span Forward/Backward; Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Digit ordering (span), Digit Span PerfO\".\n\nAlso earlier: \"Context for EXAMINER: NIH EXAMINER Computer Battery:...\"\n\nBut there is no mention that EXAMINER is a biomarker or marker. It's a battery of tests. The question: \"Recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents talk about ADAS-Cog as a cognitive outcome measure. For EXAMINER, there's no mention of being a marker. So likely invalid.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"ADAS-Cog\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"EXAMINER: NIH EXAMINER Computer Battery\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nMake sure JSON array.

They want to see if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide acronym.\n\nWe must strictly use info from documents. Let's examine context.\n\nThe context includes many references about MMSE, its usage, etc. It says: \"Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)... The MMSE is commonly used for inclusion criteria in AD clinical trials.\" So it's recognized as a measure used in AD clinical trials. But is it a biomarker? It's a cognitive test, not a biological marker. However, the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" might refer to any marker including cognitive assessments? In the context, they talk about \"markers\" maybe meaning measurement tools. The document seems to treat MMSE as a performance outcome, not necessarily a biomarker. But the user asks: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context indicates MMSE is used for inclusion criteria in AD clinical trials, so yes it's recognized as a marker (a clinical outcome measure). For Mattis Dementia Rating Scale: The context mentions \"Mattis Dementia Rating Scale: curacy in detecting AD in MCI patients found exceedingly large variability of results and concluded that no clinical recommendation could be issued based on such data [17].\" That suggests it's not validated enough. So likely not recognized as a marker per the documents. So we mark valid: false.\n\nBut we need to check if the documents mention Mattis as a marker. There's mention: \"Mattis Dementia Rating Scale: curacy in detecting AD in MCI patients found exceedingly large variability of results and concluded that no clinical recommendation could be issued based on such data [17].\" That indicates insufficient evidence. So we mark invalid.\n\nNow acronyms: For MMSE: abbreviation is MMSE. For Mattis: abbreviation is MDS? Actually the scale is called Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, often abbreviated as MDRS. Yes, the common acronym is MDRS. The context doesn't explicitly give acronym, but we know from general knowledge. But we cannot use external knowledge. Does the context mention acronym? Search: \"Mattis Dementia Rating Scale:\" appears multiple times. No acronym given. But the user expects us to provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. The documents don't mention an acronym. So we might say \"N/A\"? But the instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker\".

They want us to determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. And provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info in the context. Let's examine the context.\n\nThere are multiple paragraphs about TAU++: advanced AD tau status. It appears to refer to a biomarker measuring tau. The text says: \"Advanced AD tau status:... plasma p-tau assays...\". So TAU++ likely refers to a plasma p-tau assay? But the name 'TAU++' might be a product or assay. The context includes mention of \"p-tau\" and \"tau\" as biomarkers. Also mentions \"advanced AD tau status\" as a marker. The question: Is it recognized marker? According to documents, yes, it's a biomarker for AD. The acronym: maybe \"p-tau\" or \"tau\"? But they ask for the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. The document uses \"p-tau\" frequently. It also uses \"tau\" alone. But the specific phrase \"TAU++\" is not an acronym; it's a name. The acronym might be \"p-tau\" or \"tau\". However, the instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For TAU++, perhaps the abbreviation is \"p-tau\" because that's what the assay measures. But the document doesn't explicitly say \"TAU++ = p-tau\". It just says \"TAU++: Advanced AD tau status\". Might be a brand name. But the acronym could be \"p-tau\". Alternatively, we could say \"TAU++\" itself is the acronym. But they want the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. The document uses \"p-tau\" as abbreviation for phosphorylated tau. So I'd choose \"p-tau\".\n\nNow second item: \"RVP-A': Rapid Visual Information Processing A prime\". The context includes references to RVP-A'. It appears to be a test, not a biomarker. It's a cognitive test. The context says \"Rapid Visual Information Processing A prime: ists of methodological requirements...\" etc. It is not a biomarker. So it's not a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. So valid: false. Acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nBut we need to check if there is any mention that RVP-A' is used as a biomarker. The context says \"Rapid Visual Information Processing A prime: ists of methodological requirements and did not involve human nor animal participants.\" That suggests it's a test, not a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"...\"}\n\nReturn as JSON array? System instructions: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" They didn't specify array but likely produce array.

For each, we need to provide original_name, valid true/false, acronym.\n\nFrom context: There are many references about Florbetapir (18F) PET scan being used as a biomarker for AD. So it's a recognized marker. Acronym? The document uses 'Florbetapir (18F)' maybe abbreviation '18F-FLB'? But typical abbreviation is 'Florbetapir (18F)' itself. They might refer to 'PET scan' but no specific acronym given. However the question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For Florbetapir (18F) PET scan, the acronym could be '18F-FLB' or just 'Florbetapir'. Let's search context: It says \"Context for FLORBETAPIR-18F: Florbetapir (18F) PET scan\". No other abbreviation. Might be '18F-FLB' but not explicitly. Could also be 'PET' but that's generic. The document refers to 'PET scan' but not abbreviation. Maybe 'FLORBETAPIR-18F' itself is the identifier. So acronym could be 'FLORBETAPIR-18F' or '18F-FLB'. Since the item includes that string, we can say acronym = 'FLORBETAPIR-18F'.\n\nNow NRI: Net Reclassification Index. Is it a marker? It's a statistical measure used to evaluate predictive models, not a biological marker. The context mentions NRI in relation to tracking pathophysiological processes, but it's not a biomarker. So valid should be false. Acronym: 'NRI' is already the acronym. But since it's not a marker, we still output acronym \"N/A\" per instruction.

So we need to see if the documents mention APOE genotype as a marker. Yes, the context includes many references to APOE genotype, e.g., \"APOE ε4 carrier\", \"APOE ε4 homozygote\" etc. It says \"APOE genotyping was scheduled in all patients at baseline.\" Also \"APOE ε4 carriage is a risk factor for developing late-onset AD\". So yes, it's a recognized marker. Acronym: \"APOE\" is given. But maybe also \"APOE ε4\" or \"APOE\". The abbreviation used in the documents: \"APOE\" stands for apolipoprotein E. So we should set acronym \"APOE\".\n\nNow second: \"DONEPEZIL PC: Donepezil plasma concentration\". Does the context mention Donepezil plasma concentration? There's some context about Donepezil plasma concentration: \"DONEPEZIL PC: Donepezil plasma concentration: loid-b characterized sub‑...\". And later \"DONEPEZIL PC: Donepezil plasma concentration: l for Alzheimer’s disease treatment; 2023....\". Also references to product inserts, etc. But is Donepezil plasma concentration considered a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context seems to discuss it as a measurement, but not necessarily a biomarker. It's a pharmacokinetic measure. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention Donepezil plasma concentration but do not say it's a biomarker for AD. It might be used for therapeutic monitoring but not a disease biomarker. The context doesn't state that Donepezil plasma concentration is a marker for AD. So likely invalid. However, we need to consider if the context mentions Donepezil plasma concentration as a marker. Let's search the context: There's mention of \"DONEPEZIL PC: Donepezil plasma concentration: loid-b characterized sub‑…\". That appears to be a heading. But no explicit statement that it's a marker. The context also lists various assays like pTau217, amyloid, etc. No mention of Donepezil plasma concentration as a biomarker.

Maybe \"PC\" stands for plasma concentration. But the instruction: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For Donepezil plasma concentration, the document uses \"DONEPEZIL PC\". That's the abbreviation. But since it's not a recognized marker, we still output \"N/A\". The spec says: If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate acronym \"N/A\". So we follow that.\n\nThus final answer: array of two JSON objects. Ensure correct formatting.",

We cannot bring outside knowledge.\n\nWe need to check if 'DONEPEZIL MTD' is a recognized marker. In the context, there are many references to Donepezil maximum tolerated dose. It appears in multiple contexts: \"Context for DONEPEZIL MTD: Donepezil maximum tolerated dose\" etc. But is it considered a biomarker? It's a dosage concept, not a biomarker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". Markers are typically biomarkers like amyloid PET, CSF Aβ42, tau, etc. Donepezil MTD is not a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nHowever, the instruction says: For each element, determine if it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. So we need to look at the documents: Are there any statements that say Donepezil MTD is a marker? No. It's just a dosing reference. So it's not a marker. So valid=false.\n\nNow second: \"ADAS-COG: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive\". Is this a marker? It's an assessment scale, not a biomarker. But maybe considered a clinical outcome measure, not a biomarker. The question: \"marker for Alzheimer's\". Usually markers are biological or imaging. But the context includes ADAS-Cog as an outcome measure. The user might consider it a marker? But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". ADAS-Cog is not a biomarker. So likely invalid too. However, the user may think it's a marker because it's used to assess disease severity. But the instruction says \"must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" ADAS-Cog is correlated with Alzheimer's, but it's not a biomarker. But the requirement: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" That could apply to ADAS-Cog. But earlier they said \"marker/biomarker\". The system instructions: \"You are an expert in Alzheimer's markers (and biomarkers).\" So maybe ADAS-Cog counts as a marker? But typical classification: ADAS-Cog is a clinical rating scale, not a biomarker. But the user specifically gave those items. We need to decide.\n\nLet's read the context: There are many mentions of ADAS-Cog in the context. It is described as a performance outcome, used in clinical trials. It is correlated with disease progression. So arguably it's a marker of disease severity. The user wants to validate if it's a recognized marker. According to the documents, yes, ADAS-Cog is used as a primary endpoint in trials, so it's a recognized measure. So we can mark it as valid=true. And acronym: ADAS-Cog. Or maybe \"ADAS-Cog\" is the abbreviation. The original name includes \"ADAS-COG: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive\". The acronym would be \"ADAS-Cog\".\n\nThus output:\n\nFirst element: \"DONEPEZIL MTD: Donepezil maximum tolerated dose\" -> valid false, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nSecond element: \"ADAS-COG: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive\" -> valid true, acronym \"ADAS-Cog\".\n\nReturn JSON array with objects.\n\nMake sure formatting matches required: Each object has keys: original_name, valid, acronym.\n\nSo produce:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"DONEPEZIL MTD: Donepezil maximum tolerated dose\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"ADAS-COG: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"ADAS-Cog\"}\n]\n\nCheck punctuation: Use double quotes around strings.

If not valid, acronym \"N/A\". So we should output an array of these objects. The system didn't specify array explicitly, but we can output a JSON array containing the objects. That's acceptable.\n\nDouble-check: The first element's acronym: \"N/A\". Yes.\n\nEdge: Should we include \"DONEPEZIL MTD\" as acronym? But since invalid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nOk.",

The first item: DKEFS T4: Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Trail Making Test 4. In the context, there are mentions of DKEFS T4 in the tables. It appears as a measure name. But is it a marker? It's a neuropsychological test, not a biomarker per se. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" According to the documents.

Acronym: CMRGL. But maybe the abbreviation is \"CMRGL\" itself. The user asked: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For CMRGL, the acronym is CMRGL.

It appears in the context: \"Context for RBC MAG: Red blood cell magnesium concentration:\" but then some text about RBC MAG: Red blood cell magnesium concentration:, etc. There's mention of RBC MAG in the context. But is it considered a recognized marker? The document seems to discuss blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) for AD. RBC MAG might be one such biomarker. However we need to see if it's validated. The context says: \"Red blood cell magnesium concentration: ence\" maybe incomplete. There is also mention of RBC MAG in the list of companies.

It appears in the context: \"Context for RBC MAG: Red blood cell magnesium concentration:\" but then some text about RBC MAG: Red blood cell magnesium concentration:, etc. There's mention of RBC MAG in the context. But is it considered a recognized marker? The document seems to discuss blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) for AD. RBC MAG might be one such biomarker. However we need to see if it's validated. The context says: \"Red blood cell magnesium concentration: ence\" maybe incomplete. There is also mention of RBC MAG in the list of companies. But do we have evidence that RBC MAG is a recognized marker? The context includes references to blood-based biomarkers like pTau-217, etc. RBC MAG is not explicitly described as a biomarker. It's just listed as a context heading. Might be part of a table of biomarkers? Not sure.\n\nLet's search the context: \"RBC MAG\" appears only once: \"Context for RBC MAG: Red blood cell magnesium concentration:\" Then some lines. No further explanation. So likely insufficient evidence that RBC MAG is a recognized marker. According to guidelines, we should mark it as invalid.\n\nNow HVLT-R: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised. The context includes many mentions of HVLT-R. It is a neuropsychological test used in AD. Is it a marker? It's a cognitive test, not a biological marker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The context lists HVLT-R as a measure used in clinical trials, but not necessarily a biomarker. The instruction: \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". HVLT-R is a cognitive test, not a biomarker. So likely not a marker. But the context shows it is used as an endpoint. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents treat HVLT-R as a neuropsychological test, not a biomarker. So probably invalid.\n\nBut we need to consider whether the documents refer to HVLT-R as a marker. They say \"Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised: Type not listed\" etc. They talk about its usage.

The documents mention PK: Pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Tmax, AUClast) in context about pharmacokinetics of anti-Aβ therapies, monitoring safety biomarkers etc. But is PK itself a marker? It seems it's just a parameter used in drug development, not a biomarker for AD. So likely invalid.\n\nPKC: Protein Kinase C activity – The document mentions \"Protein Kinase C activity\" as a marker? There's a section titled \"Protein Kinase C activity:...\". It says \"Protein Kinase C activity:... markers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials.\" That suggests PKC activity might be considered a biomarker. But is there evidence? The text snippet: \"Protein Kinase C activity: rkers in Alzheimer’s disease: Towards implementation in clinical practice and trials. Lancet Neurol 21, 726-734.\" That looks like a paper title referencing PKC activity as a marker. Also earlier: \"Context for PKC: Protein Kinase C activity:...\".

The context includes many references to MMSE, MoCA, etc. There's mention of \"Mini‑Mental State Examination (variant)\" but we need to see if it's considered a marker for Alzheimer's. The context shows usage of MMSE as a measure for detection of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. It appears in multiple citations. So yes, MMSE is a recognized marker. But the specific variant 'MMEE' might be a typo? The context says \"MMEE: Mini‑Mental State Examination (variant)\". The abbreviation 'MMEE' maybe stands for something else? Actually, the text shows \"MMEE: Mini‑Mental State Examination (variant): amination\" etc. It's likely a formatting artifact. But the question: \"MMEE: Mini‑Mental State Examination (variant)\" – we need to decide if it's a recognized marker. According to the documents, MMSE is indeed used as a marker. So valid = true. Acronym: The most known abbreviation is \"MMSE\". But the document uses \"MMSE\" frequently. However the item itself is labeled \"MMEE: Mini‑Mental State Examination (variant)\". The acronym could be \"MMSE\". But the item includes \"MMEE\". Maybe the correct acronym is \"MMSE\". The instruction: Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.

So we output:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"MMEE: Mini‑Mental State Examination (variant)\",\n  \"valid\": true,\n  \"acronym\": \"MMSE\"\n}\n\nSecond, 'TG: Triglycerides'. The context includes sections about triglycerides, but do they consider triglycerides as a marker for Alzheimer's? The context mentions \"triglycerides\" in relation to lipid metabolism, but not necessarily as a biomarker. The context states \"clinical trials targeting... lipid metabolism... have used the APOEε4 genotype to enrich their populations.\" It doesn't say triglycerides themselves are a marker. There's mention of \"Triglycerides: res the awardee...\" but that's about licensing of pTau-217 technology.

Then they give a list to validate: [\"QTcF: Corrected QT interval (Fridericia's formula)\", 'Urinary Total Integrated Radioactivity: Total integrated radioactivity excreted in urine'].\n\nThey want us to determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. Use JSON format per system instructions: For each element, output object with original_name, valid true/false, acronym string. If not valid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nWe must strictly rely only on the provided documents. Let's examine the context for mentions of these items.\n\nFirst, QTcF: Corrected QT interval (Fridericia's formula). The context includes multiple references to QTcF. It appears in the first paragraph: \"Context for QTcF: Corrected QT interval (Fridericia's formula): ce not being aﬀected by small variations...\" etc. Also later: \"Context for QTcF: Corrected QT interval (Fridericia's formula):...\". So it's present. But is it described as a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The text says: \"Strongly reflects clinical trial outcomes and key features of AD; pre vs post change could be useful\" etc. It also says \"As it is measurable, it can show the level of decline, but it must be combined with amyloid biomarkers.\" That suggests it's considered a biomarker maybe? But we need to see if the document states it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The context indicates it's used in clinical trials, but is it recognized as a marker? The phrase \"Reflective of patient outcomes (assuming correct diagnosis of AD)\" suggests it's used as a biomarker. But is there explicit mention that it's a recognized marker? The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention it as part of biomarker discussion. There's no explicit statement that it's a recognized marker like \"QTcF is a biomarker for AD\". But it is referenced as a biomarker. The context: \"Large variability in use... strongly reflects clinical trial outcomes and key features of AD; pre vs post change could be useful.\" That implies it's used as a biomarker. So likely valid.\n\nBut we should check if there's any mention of abbreviation. The abbreviation is QTcF itself. The acronym is \"QTcF\". The document uses \"QTcF\" as the abbreviation. So we will output acronym \"QTcF\".\n\nSecond, Urinary Total Integrated Radioactivity: Total integrated radioactivity excreted in urine. The context includes many references to urinary total integrated radioactivity. It's used as a term. Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context says: \"Total integrated radioactivity excreted in urine:...\". It seems more like a measurement method rather than a biomarker. The context doesn't say it's a marker for AD. It might be used in measuring something else. There is no mention that urinary total integrated radioactivity is a biomarker for AD. So likely invalid.\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines? The instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" then example. Probably output an array of objects. We'll output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"QTcF: Corrected QT interval (Fridericia's formula)\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"QTcF\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"Urinary Total Integrated Radioactivity: Total integrated radioactivity excreted in urine\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nMake sure to match exactly.

It says \"Immunohistology using AT8 antibody: adigm for advancing from discovery to clinic.\" Also mentions AT8 distinguishes abnormal from normal amyloid-PET scans etc. So yes, AT8 is a marker? It's an antibody against phosphorylated tau (p-tau). But we only rely on context. The context indicates it's used as a biomarker for AD. So valid = true. Acronym: AT8 already given. They want the most known/used acronym/abbreviation. For AT8, the abbreviation is AT8 itself. So output: original_name: 'AT8: Immunohistology using AT8 antibody', valid:true, acronym:'AT8'.\n\nNow COWAT: Controlled Oral Word Association Test. Is it a marker? The context lists COWAT under Table 1 as a measure, but it's a neuropsychological test, not a biomarker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" - COWAT is a cognitive test, not a biomarker. The context says it's used to assess cognitive function, but not a biomarker. So likely invalid.

Also provide acronym.\n\nFrom context: There's mention of NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory. It appears multiple times. It's described as a measure. But is it a biomarker? Usually NPI is a behavioral assessment, not a biological marker. However the question says \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The context includes \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in AD clinical trials\" and lists various biomarkers like CSF amyloid beta, etc. Then there is mention of \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q)\" as part of endpoints. But is NPI considered a biomarker? The document may treat it as an endpoint but not necessarily a biomarker. The instruction: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" So we need to see if the documents mention NPI as a marker. The context shows NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory: Type not listed. It appears under \"Measure name\" table. It has type \"ClinRO\"? Actually earlier: \"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory: Type not listed\". Under \"Measure name\" maybe it's a measure. But is it a biomarker? The context also mentions \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q)\" as part of endpoints. But the question: \"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\" specifically. The context includes \"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory: Type not listed\" and later \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q)\". So yes, NPI is referenced. Is it recognized as a marker? The context seems to treat it as a measure, possibly a clinical rating. Not sure if considered a biomarker. The instruction: \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". The context includes \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in AD clinical trials\" and lists many biomarkers. NPI is not fluid-based or imaging. It's a questionnaire. So likely not considered a biomarker. But the question might consider it as a marker because it's used as an outcome measure. But the phrase \"recognised marker for Alzheimer's\" could include non-biological markers? The context uses \"markers\" loosely? Let's examine the text: \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in AD clinical trials Individual biomarkers summarized CSF – amyloid beta (Aβ), CSF – tau, CSF – amyloid beta and tau ratios, Amyloid PET, Tau PET, Volumetric MRI\". That section explicitly lists biomarkers. NPI is not in that list. Later: \"Individual biomarkers summarized\" again. So NPI is not a biomarker. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nNow FDG-PET: 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography. The context includes references to FDG-PET as a biomarker. For example: \"Context for FDG-PET: 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography: framework. Neurobiol Aging. 2017;52:196–213.\" And further: \"Context for FDG-PET: 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography: of Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimers Dement. 2018, 14, 535–562.\" Also \"Context for FDG-PET: 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography, single-photon emission tomography, and structural MR imaging for prediction of rapid conversion to Alzheimer disease...\" So FDG-PET is definitely a biomarker. Acronym: FDG-PET. The full name is 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography. The acronym used in documents: FDG-PET. So we can say valid true, acronym \"FDG-PET\".\n\nThus output JSON array with objects for each element.\n\nNeed to follow required format: For each element, use JSON structure: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"...\"}.\n\nReturn array? The instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" It doesn't specify array but likely produce separate JSON objects. Could produce array of objects. I'll produce array.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n{\"original_name\":\"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n{\"original_name\":\"FDG-PET: 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"FDG-PET\"}\n]\n\nCheck that acronym matches docs: Yes.\n\nMake sure no extra keys.

It's listed as a measure name, type PerfO, frequency etc. But is it a marker? The context says it's a neuropsychological test battery. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" – The document seems to treat it as a measure, not necessarily a biomarker. But the instruction: \"marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The context includes references to Digit Span as part of neuropsychological tests used in AD. However, is there evidence that Digit Span is a recognized marker? The context shows it's used in measuring progression from MCI to AD. But is it a biomarker? The context lists it as a measure, but not explicitly as a biomarker. The user asks strictly based on the information provided. So we need to decide if it's validated as a marker. The context mentions \"Digit Span: Type not listed\" and \"Digit Span: pathology to define clinical AD\". That suggests it's used to define clinical AD. But is it a recognized marker? The context says \"context of use defined for the SBR consists of diagnosing people with MCI in memory clinics... potential use of tau biomarkers should not be ruled out for not serving an AD diagnosis specifically.\" That refers to tau biomarkers, not Digit Span. The context also says \"Digit Span: ed improvement) to 7 (marked worsening)\" referencing improvements. But still unclear.\n\nGiven the instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The context includes citations about MMSE being used for classification of moderate stages of dementia, etc. For Digit Span, there's no explicit citation linking it to AD. It's just listed as a measure. So likely invalid.\n\nBut maybe the context includes \"Digit Span: pathology to define clinical AD but also categorize individuals with positive tau and negative Aβ...\" That suggests it's used to define clinical AD. So maybe it's considered a marker. But the context doesn't give a specific acronym. The abbreviation is DS: Digit Span. The acronym could be DS. But the user expects the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For Digit Span, the abbreviation is DS. For MMSE, the abbreviation is MMSE. So output accordingly.\n\nThus:\n\nFor DS: Digit Span -> valid? I'd lean invalid because not clearly a biomarker. But the context says \"pathology to define clinical AD\" which might qualify.

It says \"Amyloid beta fragment 1-42\" etc. There is mention of plasma ABeta 42, ABeta 40, ABeta 42/40 ratio. Also mentions ABeta 38? Let's search within context: I see \"ABeta 1-38 (plasma): Amyloid beta fragment 1-38 in plasma\". Yes it's present. So both items appear in the context. Are they recognized markers? The context states that plasma levels of Aβ42, Aβ40, and Aβ42/40 ratio have been studied; lower plasma Aβ levels in AD vs controls; can distinguish abnormal from normal PET scans. That indicates recognition. For ABeta 1-38, context says \"Amyloid beta fragment 1-38 in plasma\" but doesn't explicitly say it's a recognized marker. But there are references to plasma ABeta 38? The context lists \"ABeta 1-38 (plasma)\" but no explicit statement of its validity. However, the context includes references to \"ABeta 1-38 (plasma): Amyloid beta fragment 1-38 in plasma\" and some references. But does the text mention that ABeta 1-38 is a biomarker? It might be part of the same set of fragments measured. The context says \"Plasma amyloid-β A large bulk of literature evaluated the plasma levels of A‑42, A‑40, and the A‑42/40 ratio in AD using different platforms.\" No mention of A‑38. But earlier in the context, there were references to ABeta 1-38 (plasma) with citations. But no explicit claim that it's a recognized marker. The question: \"Based STRICTLY on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to decide validity. For ABeta 1-42: definitely recognized. Acronym likely \"Aβ42\" or \"ABeta 1-42\"? The document uses \"ABeta 1-42\" and \"Aβ42\". The most known abbreviation is \"Aβ42\". But the context uses \"ABeta 1-42\" as name. The acronym could be \"Aβ42\". But maybe \"ABeta\" is the abbreviation. The instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" So we look for acronyms in the context. The context shows \"ABeta 1-42\" as full name, but also \"Aβ42\" appears in some lines: \"inverse relation between in vivo amyloid imaging load and cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42\". So \"Abeta42\" is used. So the acronym is \"Abeta42\" or \"Aβ42\". Use \"Aβ42\".\n\nFor ABeta 1-38 (plasma): The context uses \"ABeta 1-38 (plasma): Amyloid beta fragment 1-38 in plasma\". Does it provide an acronym? It may use \"Abeta38\" or \"Aβ38\". The context has \"ABeta 1-38 (plasma)\" but no other abbreviation. Might be \"Abeta38\". But we need to check if it's recognized. The context does not state that ABeta 1-38 is a recognized marker. It just lists it. There's no mention of its correlation with AD. So we should mark it as invalid. But we need to consider whether the context includes enough evidence. The context includes references to ABeta 1-38 (plasma) but no discussion of its significance. The user wants strictness. I'd mark ABeta 1-38 as not validated because no evidence of being a recognized marker.

The context includes \"Other promising biomarkers\" including NfL, GFAP, etc. No mention of sAPP-alpha or sAPP-beta as markers. So likely not recognized markers per documents.

It's described as a measure used to stage AD, capturing cognition and function. It is used as a primary endpoint in early AD RCTs. So yes, it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The acronym is CDR. But the item includes 'CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale', so original_name is exactly that string. The acronym would be CDR. So valid = true.\n\nSecond, 'VX-745: concentration in plasma and CSF'. Let's see context. There's mention of VX-745: concentration in plasma and CSF. But reading the context: \"Context for VX-745: concentration in plasma and CSF:...\". Then some text about technology for measurement of pTau-217, licensed to C2N Diagnostics. That seems unrelated to VX-745? Wait, maybe VX-745 is a drug? Actually, VX-745 might be a small molecule inhibitor? But the context says \"concentration in plasma and CSF\" but then mentions technology for measuring pTau-217. There is no explicit statement that VX-745 is a biomarker. The context may refer to a drug's concentration measured in plasma and CSF. But the question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The document doesn't say that VX-745 is a biomarker. It just mentions concentration in plasma and CSF. That could be a pharmacokinetic measure, not a biomarker. So likely not considered a marker. The acronym: maybe VX-745 itself is the name. But the question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For VX-745, the abbreviation is VX-745. But is it a marker? No. So valid=false, acronym=\"N/A\".\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any mention of VX-745 being a biomarker. Search context: \"VX-745: concentration in plasma and CSF:\" appears. Then references to pTau-217, etc. No mention of VX-745 as a biomarker. So we treat as invalid.\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects.\n\nNeed to match required format: For each element, use JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"...\",\n  \"valid\": true/false,\n  \"acronym\": \"...\"\n}\n\nSo produce array? The instruction says \"For each element, use this JSON structure\". Could output separate JSON objects separated by newline? Usually they'd expect an array. But spec didn't explicitly say array. But typical tasks: produce a JSON array of objects. I'll produce an array.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"CDR\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"VX-745: concentration in plasma and CSF\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck that we didn't add extra keys. Good.\n\nReturn only JSON.",
    "response": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale\",\n    \"valid\": true,\n    \"acronym\": \"CDR\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"VX-745: concentration in plasma and CSF\",\n    \"valid\": false,\n    \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n```"

Need to check two items: 'IL-8: interleukin-8 level in cerebrospinal fluid' and 'HVLT: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test total recall score'.\n\nWe need to see if these are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to documents. Also find the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in documents.\n\nFrom context: There is mention of IL-8: interleukin-8 level in cerebrospinal fluid. It appears in the text: \"Context for IL-8: interleukin-8 level in cerebrospinal fluid: adigm for advancingfromdiscoverytoclinic.AlzheimersDement13,45-58.\" And further: \"Context for IL-8: interleukin-8 level in cerebrospinal fluid: her biomarker…\". So IL-8 is discussed as a biomarker. But we need to confirm it's recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The context says: \"interleukin-8 level in cerebrospinal fluid: her biomarker—plasma-based or not—reflecting AD risk factors... have been evaluated in AD.\" That suggests IL-8 is considered a biomarker. So yes, it's recognized.\n\nBut we also need to provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in documents. For IL-8, the abbreviation is IL-8 itself. But maybe they want \"IL-8\" as the acronym. The document uses \"IL-8\" as abbreviation. So output: \"IL-8\".\n\nNow HVLT: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test total recall score. The context includes many tables listing measures like HVLT, HVLT-R, etc. It's listed as a measure but is it a biomarker? It's a neuropsychological test, not a biological marker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context shows HVLT as a measurement tool used in clinical assessments, not a biomarker. The instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" HVLT is mentioned, but is it a marker? It's a test, not a biomarker. The user might consider it a marker? But the context says \"measure name\" and type \"PerfO\" (performance outcome). It's a cognitive test. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents treat HVLT as a measure used in clinical trials, but not necessarily a biomarker. The user may still consider it a marker? But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". HVLT is not a biomarker.

It says \"Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study - Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC)\" and earlier \"ADCS-CGIC\" is described. So yes it's a recognized marker? It's an endpoint measure, not a biomarker per se. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The context includes ADCS-CGIC as an endpoint measure used in trials. It is indeed a recognized measurement tool. So valid = true. Acronym: ADCS-CGIC. That matches the abbreviation given.\n\nSecond: \"mADCS-CGIC: Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\"\n\nIs there mention of mADCS-CGIC? The context shows \"mADCS-CGIC: Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\" but also references \"Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\" maybe as a variant. Let's search context: There's a section titled \"mADCS-CGIC: Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\". It seems to appear in the context. However, is it recognized as a marker? The text might say \"modified\" but not necessarily validated. The context may include it as a concept but not necessarily recognized. The user wants to see if it's recognized marker according to documents. The document includes mention of mADCS-CGIC but likely not widely used. The context: \"mADCS-CGIC: Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\" appears in the heading. But do we have evidence that it's recognized? The context includes some citations referencing mADCS-CGIC but not sure if it's used as a marker. The context includes \"mADCS-CGIC: Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\" but no explicit statement that it's a recognized marker. Might be just a modified version. The user says \"Based STRICTLY on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus for mADCS-CGIC, we need to decide if it's recognized. The context includes mention of \"mADCS-CGIC\" but not necessarily recognized. The context includes \"mADCS-CGIC: Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\" but no explanation. The context also includes \"ADCS-CGIC\" as a recognized measure. The \"m\" prefix indicates a modification. But is it recognized? The context doesn't explicitly state that mADCS-CGIC is a recognized marker. It might be a new or hypothetical variant. Without explicit mention, we should treat it as not recognized. So valid=false, acronym=\"N/A\"? Or maybe acronym \"mADCS-CGIC\"? But the instruction: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" If it's not recognized, we set acronym \"N/A\". So output:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\":\"ADCS-CGIC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\",\n  \"valid\":true,\n  \"acronym\":\"ADCS-CGIC\"\n},\n{\n  \"original_name\":\"mADCS-CGIC: Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\",\n  \"valid\":false,\n  \"acronym\":\"N/A\"\n}\n\nBut double-check: The context includes \"mADCS-CGIC: Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\" as a heading. But is there any mention of it being used? The context includes \"mADCS-CGIC: Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change\" but then lists \"Context for mADCS-CGIC: Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change: Citation: Gunes, S.;...\" etc. It seems like a separate section. But still, is it recognized? The context might not provide enough evidence. So safe to mark invalid.\n\nThus produce JSON array?

Usually biomarkers are biological molecules measured in fluids or imaging. ADAS-Cog is a clinical assessment. Might still be considered a marker? The context uses \"marker\" loosely? The user says \"potential Alzheimer's markers\". The context lists ADAS-Cog as an outcome measure. The user wants to validate them as markers. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" ADAS-Cog is indeed correlated with AD severity. So maybe it's considered a marker. But the context specifically refers to ADAS-Cog as an outcome measure, not a biomarker. But the user didn't specify biomarker vs other markers. The system instructions: \"You are an expert in Alzheimer's markers (and biomarkers).\" So we can treat ADAS-Cog as a marker.

The instruction: \"Your task is to analyze a list of potential markers extracted from datasets and validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" And \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" So we need to see if the document states that these are markers. For CSDD, it's listed under \"Measure name\" table, type ClinRO, etc. It is used as an endpoint measure. Does the document say it's a marker? It might be considered a clinical outcome measure rather than a biomarker. But still could be considered a marker? The instruction: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker\". For CSDD, the abbreviation is C-SDD? Wait the list shows \"Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (C-SDD)\". But the item given is 'CSDD: Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia'. That abbreviation is CSDD. The document uses C-SDD. Might be same. So we can provide acronym C-SDD or CSDD? The instruction: \"provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker\". So we should give C-SDD maybe. But the item itself includes CSDD. Which one is more common? The document uses C-SDD. We'll output \"C-SDD\".\n\nNow Barthel index: Search context. I saw no mention of Barthel index. There's mention of Barthel index in some other part? At bottom: \"Context for Barthel index: Citation: Gunes...\" but that's about biomarkers review. Not sure if Barthel index is mentioned. The text: \"Context for Barthel index: Citation: Gunes, S.;... Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in the Current State: A Narrative Review.\" That seems unrelated. There is no mention of Barthel index in the tables. So likely not a recognized marker per documents. So mark valid false, acronym N/A.\n\nThus produce JSON array with objects.\n\nBut the required format: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably an array of objects. Provide each object separately? They didn't specify array but example shows each object separate. We'll output array.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"CSDD: Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"C‑SDD\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"Barthel index\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nMake sure formatting correct.

Let's examine the context for IL-8 and IL-9.\n\nThe context includes multiple references about IL-8: \"Context for IL-8: Interleukin-8: adigm for advancingfromdiscoverytoclinic.AlzheimersDement13,45-58.\" Then later: \"Context for IL-8: Interleukin-8: d a speciﬁcity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" And earlier: \"Context for IL-8: Interleukin-8: hon L,\" etc. It seems there is mention of IL-8 as a biomarker. There's also mention of IL-9: \"Context for IL-9: Interleukin-9: erging pathology in Alzheimer’s disease. EBioMedicine 76, 103836.\" Another: \"Context for IL-9: Interleukin-9: curacy in detecting AD in MCI patients found exceedingly large variability of results and concluded that no clinical recommendation could be issued based on such data [17].\"\n\nAlso: \"Context for IL-9: Interleukin-9: d a speciﬁcity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" Wait that's same as IL-8? Actually maybe mis-copied. But we need to check.\n\nLet's search within the context for IL-8 and IL-9. The context shows repeated lines referencing IL-8 and IL-9. There is mention of IL-8 having specificity 93.3% and AUC 0.94 to diagnose AD. That suggests IL-8 is considered a marker. For IL-9, there's mention of \"curacy in detecting AD in MCI patients found exceedingly large variability of results and concluded that no clinical recommendation could be issued based on such data [17].\" So IL-9 may not be validated.\n\nBut we need to decide if IL-9 is recognized marker. The text says \"no clinical recommendation could be issued based on such data\". That indicates insufficient evidence. So likely invalid.\n\nNow we need to produce JSON objects for each element.\n\nOriginal names: 'IL-8: Interleukin-8', 'IL-9: Interleukin-9'.\n\nValid: IL-8: yes. IL-9: no.\n\nAcronym: For IL-8, the acronym is IL-8 itself. But the question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" The document uses \"IL-8\" as abbreviation. So acronym: IL-8.\n\nFor IL-9: Since it's not a valid marker, acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"IL-8: Interleukin-8\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"IL-8\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"IL-9: Interleukin-9\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nMake sure JSON format exactly as required: Each object separate line? They didn't specify array. They said \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" So we can output array of objects. Or just separate objects? Usually they'd expect array. We'll output array.\n\nCheck formatting: Use double quotes around keys and string values. Booleans without quotes. Good.\n\nReturn only JSON. No explanation.",

    },
    "cot": "We need to parse the context. The user provides a long context about various references. They ask to analyze two items: 'Amyloid β2: Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid beta 2' and 'ACE2: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2'.\n\nWe must determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. And provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly rely only on the provided documents. So we need to see if the documents mention these markers as recognized biomarkers.\n\nFirst, Amyloid β2: Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid beta 2. The context includes many references about CSF amyloid beta 42, 40 etc. There's mention of \"Amyloid β2\" but maybe it's a typo? Let's search within context: \"Amyloid β2:\" appears at top: \"Context for Amyloid β2: Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid beta 2: adigm for advancing...\" It seems they refer to \"Amyloid β2\" as a marker. But typical biomarker is Aβ42, Aβ40, Aβ42:40 ratio. There is no standard \"Amyloid β2\". However, the context might treat \"Amyloid β2\" as a marker. But we need to check if the documents mention it as recognized marker. The references talk about CSF Aβ42, Aβ40, etc. No mention of Aβ2. So likely not recognized.\n\nBut the first line says \"Context for Amyloid β2: Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid beta 2: adigm for advancing...\". That suggests they consider it as a marker. But is there evidence? The rest of the context mentions \"Aβ42, total Tau (tTau), phosphorylated Tau (pTau), Aβ42:40 ratio, and pTau:Aβ42 ratio\". No mention of Aβ2. So I'd say it's not recognized.\n\nThus for Amyloid β2: Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid beta 2 -> valid: false, acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nSecond, ACE2: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2. The context includes multiple references about ACE2. For example, \"Context for ACE2: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2: Citation: Gunes, S.;... Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in the Current State: A Narrative Review.\" Also other references mention ACE2. But is ACE2 considered a recognized biomarker for Alzheimer's? The context includes mention of ACE2 in the narrative review. But does it state that ACE2 is a biomarker? Let's read: The snippet: \"Context for ACE2: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2: Citation: Gunes, S.;... Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in the Current State: A Narrative Review.\" That indicates ACE2 is discussed as a biomarker. Also earlier: \"Context for ACE2: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al. Tracking pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease: an updated hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers.\" That also implies ACE2 is part of biomarker discussion. So yes, ACE2 is recognized as a biomarker.\n\nNow what is the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents? For ACE2, the abbreviation is ACE2 itself. So acronym: \"ACE2\".\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object should contain original_name, valid, acronym. Use boolean true/false. For invalid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nReturn as JSON array? System instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {... }\". It doesn't specify array but likely produce separate JSON objects separated by newline or array. Usually they'd want an array. I'll produce an array of objects.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"Amyloid β2: Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid beta 2\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"ACE2: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"ACE2\"}\n]\n\nEnsure no extra text.",

We have two items: 'P-tau: Phosphorylated Tau' and 'IL-7: Interleukin-7'.\n\nWe need to check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. For each, we need to provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nFrom the context, there is extensive mention of P-tau (phosphorylated tau) and various forms: p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231, etc. It is definitely a recognized marker. Acronym likely \"p-tau\" or \"P-tau\". But the question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" In the context, they refer to \"p-tau\", \"p-tau181\", \"p-tau217\", \"p-tau231\". They also sometimes say \"P-tau\". So the abbreviation could be \"p-tau\". But maybe \"p-tau\" is the abbreviation. The full name is \"Phosphorylated Tau\". So the acronym would be \"p-tau\".\n\nNow IL-7: Interleukin-7. The context includes references about IL-7 but no direct mention of IL-7 being a marker for Alzheimer's. There is some mention of IL-7 in the context: \"Interleukin-7: Citation: Gunes, S.;... Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease...\" Also \"Interleukin-7:... res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". There's also mention of \"Interleukin-7: erging pathology in Alzheimer’s disease. EBioMedicine 76, 103836.\" But do they present IL-7 as a marker? The context seems to include IL-7 but not necessarily validated as a marker. The instruction says: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So we need to see if IL-7 is considered a recognized marker. The context mentions IL-7 but doesn't explicitly say it's a marker for Alzheimer's. It's just referencing IL-7 in general. So likely invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"Context for IL-7: Interleukin-7: Citation: Gunes, S.;...\" That might be a review of biomarkers including IL-7. But does the document mention IL-7 as a biomarker? Let's search within the context: \"IL-7\" appears in the text: \"Context for IL-7: Interleukin-7: Citation: Gunes, S.;...\". Then later: \"Context for IL-7: Interleukin-7: 4] Jia J, Ning Y, Chen M, Wang S, Yang H, Li F, et al. Biomarker changes during 20 years preceding Alzheimer’s disease. N Engl J Med 2024;390(8):712–22.\" That reference might discuss IL-7 as part of biomarker changes. But the context doesn't explicitly state IL-7 is a marker. It just lists references. The instruction: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus, for IL-7, we need to decide if it's recognized. The context includes IL-7 but not explicit validation. I'd lean to invalid because there's insufficient evidence that IL-7 is a recognized marker per the documents. However, the context includes a review titled \"Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in the Current State: A Narrative Review\" which presumably covers many biomarkers, possibly including IL-7. But the excerpt doesn't show IL-7 being described as a marker. It just cites the paper. Without explicit statement, we cannot confirm.\n\nTherefore, output:\n\nFor P-tau: valid true, acronym \"p-tau\".\n\nFor IL-7: valid false, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nReturn JSON array? The required format: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably produce an array of objects. The system instructions: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" then shows object. So we should output an array of objects. Or maybe just multiple objects separated? Usually they'd want an array. We'll output an array.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"P-tau: Phosphorylated Tau\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"p-tau\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"IL-7: Interleukin-7\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object keys exactly as specified.

For VCAM-1: The context says \"Context for VCAM-1: Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1: Citation: Gunes, S.;... Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in the Current State: A Narrative Review.\" So VCAM-1 is discussed as a biomarker. Also other references mention VCAM-1? There's mention of \"Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1\" in the context. So yes it's a recognized marker per documents. Acronym: VCAM-1. They already give that. So valid=true, acronym=\"VCAM-1\".\n\nNow ADCS-ADL-MCI: It's a measurement instrument, not a biomarker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". It is a clinical outcome assessment, not a biological marker. The context lists many COAs including ADCS-ADL-MCI. But the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate...\" So we should mark it invalid. Acronym: \"N/A\". Because it's not a biomarker.

In the context, it's listed under \"Measure name\" and type \"PerfO\" (performance outcome). It is used for classification of dementia severity. So yes, it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's per documents. Acronym: MMSE.\n\nNow PSS: Perceived Stress Scale. The context includes PSS: Perceived Stress Scale. But is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context lists many measures including PSS: Perceived Stress Scale. However, we need to see if it's recognized as a marker for Alzheimer's. The document seems to list it among various measures, but no explicit statement about its validity as a marker. It might be a measure of stress, not necessarily a biomarker for AD. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents do not provide evidence that PSS is a marker for AD. It appears only as a measure in the list. There's no mention of correlation with AD.

The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" – biomarker. The context mentions \"blood-based biomarkers\" etc. But RMBPC seems like a behavioral assessment tool, not a biological marker. However, the instruction: \"validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" So we look at the documents: The table lists \"RMBPC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist\" as a measure type. It has \"Type of COAa\" maybe \"ClinRO\"? Actually the table shows \"Measure name\", \"Type of COAa\", \"Disease severity\". For RMBPC, there is no entry?

So we can say acronym: ABETA.\n\nNow ARIA: amyloid‑related imaging abnormalities. The context includes mention of ARIA. It's described as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. It is a term used in the context of imaging abnormalities associated with amyloid therapy. Is it considered a marker? The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". ARIA is not a biomarker per se; it's an adverse event or imaging finding. But the context says \"Context for ARIA: amyloid‑related imaging abnormalities\" and there are sections describing ARIA. It might be considered a marker? The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The documents refer to ARIA as a concept, but not necessarily a biomarker. The context indicates ARIA is used in imaging contexts. But is it a marker? The text: \"Context for ARIA: amyloid‑related imaging abnormalities:...\". There's no explicit statement that ARIA is a biomarker for AD. It seems to be a side effect or imaging abnormality. The user asks: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" I think ARIA is not a biomarker; it's an imaging abnormality that can occur during treatment. So we should mark it as invalid. But let's double-check.\n\nSearch the context: \"ARIA: amyloid‑related imaging abnormalities\" appears in the list. The context includes \"Context for ARIA: amyloid‑related imaging abnormalities: ful accuracy.\" etc. It describes ARIA as part of imaging abnormalities. It doesn't say it's a biomarker. The user specifically says \"marker for Alzheimer's\". ARIA is not a biomarker; it's an imaging abnormality. So we mark as invalid.\n\nBut we need to check if there's any mention that ARIA is used as a biomarker. The context: \"Context for ARIA: amyloid‑related imaging abnormalities: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". That suggests ARIA is part of biomarker profiles? Wait, reading: \"Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". That sentence refers to biomarker profiles, not ARIA. The phrase \"Context for ARIA: amyloid‑related imaging abnormalities:\" appears multiple times. But no direct claim that ARIA is a biomarker. It's just a term.\n\nThus we set valid: false, acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nBut the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\"\n\nSo produce JSON array? The system instructions: For each element, use this JSON structure. Probably output an array of objects. The user didn't specify array but said \"Provide the answer in the JSON format specified in the system instructions.\" The system instructions earlier: \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {...}\". So we can output an array of those objects. Or separate objects? Usually they'd expect an array. We'll output an array.\n\nThus:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"ABETA: amyloid‑beta peptide (N‑terminal 1‑14)\", \"valid\":true, \"acronym\":\"ABETA\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"ARIA: amyloid‑related imaging abnormalities\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nMake sure formatting correct.

They ask to analyze list ['DSST: Digit Symbol Substitution Test', 'ApoE: Apolipoprotein E genotype'].\n\nNeed to determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to documents. Also provide acronym.\n\nFrom context: DSST appears multiple times. It is described as a neuropsychological test battery, used for measuring cognitive function. But is it considered a biomarker? The context says \"digit symbol substitution test\" type not listed. It's a cognitive test, not a biological marker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". Usually biomarkers are biological molecules like proteins, etc. But the context includes DSST as a measure. However the instruction: \"validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" So we look at documents: DSST is listed under \"Measure name\", \"Type of COAa\" maybe \"PerfO\" meaning performance outcome? It is a cognitive test. Is it recognized as a marker? The document seems to treat it as a measure used in clinical trials, but not necessarily a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention DSST as part of neuropsychological test battery. It might be used as an outcome measure but not a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut let's check: The context includes \"Context for DSST: Digit Symbol Substitution Test: Type not listed\" repeated. That suggests it's not a biomarker. So we mark valid: false.\n\nNow acronym: The most known abbreviation for DSST is \"DSST\" itself. But they want \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker\". For DSST, the abbreviation is DSST. So we put \"DSST\".\n\nSecond: ApoE: Apolipoprotein E genotype. The context mentions APOE genotype, APOE ε4 allele, etc. It is definitely a recognized genetic risk factor for AD. So valid: true. Acronym: \"APOE\" or \"APOE ε4\"? The most known abbreviation is \"APOE\". The context uses \"APOE\" as abbreviation. So we output \"APOE\".\n\nThus produce JSON array? The required format: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably produce array of objects.

But we need to check if it's recognized as a marker. The text says \"Context for sROI index: standardized region-of-interest index from FDG-PET: the AD pathological continuum and the dissociation between AD pathology and cognitive decline\". That suggests it's a metric used in FDG-PET imaging. Is it considered a biomarker? It's likely a measure used in research. But is it validated? The document doesn't provide explicit validation data. It just mentions context. So maybe it's not fully validated as a marker. However, the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\" - The documents mention sROI index as part of FDG-PET metrics. It might be considered a biomarker. But do we have evidence? There's no cut-offs etc. But the context indicates it's used to evaluate AD pathological continuum. Might be considered a marker. But the instruction: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above.\" So we must decide based on presence. For sROI index, there is mention of \"Context for sROI index: standardized region-of-interest index from FDG-PET: the AD pathological continuum...\". That implies it's a marker. So valid = true.

Similarly, ReHo_lIPL: \"Regional Homogeneity left inferior parietal lobule: l as a predictive biomarker for dementia and related endophenotypes.\" That line suggests ReHo_lIPL is considered a predictive biomarker.

The sentence: \"Context for ReHo_lIPL: Regional Homogeneity left inferior parietal lobule: l as a predictive biomarker for dementia and related endophenotypes. JAMA Neurol 76, 598-606.\" That indicates a paper where ReHo_lIPL is used as a predictive biomarker. So yes, it's recognized.\n\nBut for fALFF_rIPL, there's no such explicit statement. It's just listed as part of context. Might be used in a study but not necessarily recognized.

'RBANS: Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status'\n\nContext: RBANS is a neuropsychological test battery, not a biomarker. The question: \"list to validate\" includes RBANS. Are they asking if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The document states RBANS is used for detection of cognitive impairment, but it's a test, not a biomarker. The instruction: \"determine if it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". RBANS is not a biomarker; it's a cognitive assessment tool. So should be marked invalid.

The document says \"ECog: Everyday Cognition Scale: Context for ECog: Everyday Cognition Scale:...\". It seems it's a measurement tool, not a biomarker per se. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" – could refer to a biomarker or a scale? The context includes many COAs (clinical outcome assessments). They are measuring cognition etc. So maybe they consider ECog as a marker? The instruction: \"validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" For each element, we must determine if it's actually a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's. The documents talk about ECog as a measure. It might be considered a marker? But the context says \"ECog: Everyday Cognition Scale: Type not listed\" and then later \"ECog: Everyday Cognition Scale: is is the experience and thoughts of our expert authors\". It doesn't explicitly say it's a biomarker. But it's a measure used in AD research. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". I think yes, ECog is a recognized measure used in AD. So valid true. Acronym: ECog. Or maybe abbreviation: ECog. The document uses \"ECog: Everyday Cognition Scale\". So acronym is ECog.\n\nSecond: ARIA-E: Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormality-Edema. Is this a marker? It's a side effect of amyloid therapies, not a biomarker. The context describes ARIA-E as a phenomenon. It is not a biomarker for AD. So likely invalid. Acronym: ARIA-E.

The document says \"Maximum concentration of CAD106-induced antibody titers: adigm for advancing from discovery to clinic.\" That seems to be a metric used in a specific study, but is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context indicates it's a measurement used in a study, but not necessarily a biomarker for diagnosing AD.

Let's search the context.\n\nI see many references to \"pTau-217\" etc. But I don't see mention of \"T1/2\" or \"AUCtau\" as markers. There are mentions of \"Terminal elimination half-life\" in the context, but it's just part of a sentence about \"Context for T1/2: Terminal elimination half-life\". It seems like a heading or note about the abbreviation. But is it considered a marker? The text says \"Context for T1/2: Terminal elimination half-life: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". That appears to be some meta-information about the document's formatting, not a biological marker. There's no mention that T1/2 is used as a biomarker for Alzheimer's. Similarly, \"AUCtau: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve over dosing interval\" appears in the context, but again it's just a description of what the abbreviation stands for. No mention that AUCtau is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The context includes many references to CSF tau, pTau, Aβ, etc. But not T1/2 or AUCtau.\n\nThus likely neither is a recognized marker. So both should be marked as valid: false, acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nBut maybe the question expects that T1/2 and AUCtau are not markers. The instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So yes, both invalid.\n\nHowever, we might consider that the abbreviation \"T1/2\" is used in the context as \"Terminal elimination half-life\", but that's not a biomarker. It's a pharmacokinetic parameter. Not relevant to Alzheimer's. So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, \"AUCtau\" is described as \"Area under the plasma concentration-time curve over dosing interval\".

    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They provide a long context from documents about various measures, but specifically they ask to analyze two items: ['PSQI: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index', 'Blood Chemistry: blood chemistry parameters'].\n\nThey want to determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and give the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly rely only on the provided context. We cannot bring outside knowledge.\n\nLet's examine the context for PSQI: There is mention: \"Context for PSQI: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: Type not listed\" earlier. Also later: \"Context for PSQI: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: 6–35.\" So PSQI appears in the document. But is it considered a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context shows it's a measure used in the study, but not necessarily a biomarker. It might be a clinical outcome assessment (COA). The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The context includes many measures like MoCA, MMSE, etc. PSQI is a sleep quality index. Is it a recognized marker? The context doesn't explicitly say it's a biomarker. It's a measure used in the study. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention PSQI but do not state it's a biomarker. It may be used as a measure of sleep quality, which could correlate with AD risk, but not necessarily a biomarker. The instruction says: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The context does not provide such correlation. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nBut maybe the context includes references to PSQI being used in AD studies. Let's search the context: There's \"Context for PSQI: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: Type not listed\" and \"Context for PSQI: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: 6–35.\" No further mention. So likely not validated as a marker.\n\nNow Blood Chemistry: The context mentions \"blood chemistry parameters\" multiple times. It refers to blood biomarkers, plasma biomarkers, etc. For example: \"blood chemistry parameters: 37] Dubois B, Villain N, Schneider L, Fox N, Campbell N, et al. Alzheimer disease as a clinical-biological construct – an International Working Group recommendation.\" And also \"Hansson O, Edelmayer RM, Boxer AL, Carrillo MC, Mielke MM, et al. The Alzheimer’s Association appropriate use recommendations for blood biomarkers in Alzheimer’s disease.\" Also \"Schindler SE, Galasko D, Pereira AC, Rabinovici GD, Salloway S, et al. Acceptable performance of blood biomarker tests of amyloid pathology – recommendations from the Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer’s Disease.\" And \"Mielke MM, Anderson M, Ashford JW, Jeromin A, Lin P-J, et al. Recommendations for clinical implementation of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease.\" So blood chemistry parameters refer to blood biomarkers. Are these recognized markers? Yes, blood biomarkers like plasma p-tau181, p-tau217, amyloid beta, etc. But the specific term \"blood chemistry parameters\" is generic. The context uses it as a category. The question: \"Blood Chemistry: blood chemistry parameters\". Does the document mention that blood chemistry parameters are recognized markers? The context indicates that blood biomarkers are recommended for use. So yes, blood chemistry parameters are recognized markers. But what is the acronym? The context might mention \"BBMs\" for blood-based biomarkers. Or \"pTau-217\" etc. But the phrase \"blood chemistry parameters\" itself is not given an acronym. However, the context includes \"BBMs\" abbreviation for blood-based biomarkers. But the user asks: \"the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For PSQI, the acronym is \"PSQI\". For blood chemistry parameters, perhaps \"BBMs\" or \"blood biomarkers\". The context uses \"blood-based biomarkers\" and \"BBMs\". Let's check: In the text: \"The scope focuses on individuals with objective cognitive impairment... where AD is the suspected underlying...\" Not sure. Search for \"BBM\" in context: There's \"biomarkers (BBMs)\" in the line: \"biomarkers (BBMs) in the diagnostic workup of suspected Alzheimer’s disease (AD)\". So BBMs stands for blood-based biomarkers. That seems relevant. So we can use \"BBMs\".\n\nThus produce JSON objects:\n\nFirst: PSQI: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index -> valid? According to documents, not a recognized marker. So valid: false, acronym: \"PSQI\".\n\nSecond: Blood Chemistry: blood chemistry parameters -> valid: true, acronym: \"BBMs\".\n\nBut we need to ensure that the acronym matches the most known/used abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For blood chemistry parameters, the abbreviation \"BBMs\" is used. Alternatively, \"blood biomarkers\" might be abbreviated as \"BBMs\". So we will use \"BBMs\".\n\nCheck if there is any other abbreviation: \"pTau-217\" is a specific biomarker. But the item is \"Blood Chemistry: blood chemistry parameters\", so the general category. The abbreviation \"BBMs\" fits.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"PSQI: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"PSQI\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"Blood Chemistry: blood chemistry parameters\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"BBMs\"}\n]\n\nMake sure JSON array. Ensure correct formatting.",

Let's examine the context for each.\n\nFirst item: 'cNTB: Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery Z-Scores'. In the context, we see many references to \"Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery\" and \"cNTB\". For example, early lines: \"Context for cNTB: Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery Z-Scores: Type not listed\". Also later: \"Context for cNTB: Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery Z-Scores: 14–29. [32]...\". So cNTB appears multiple times. It seems to be a measure used in the study. Is it a recognized marker? It's a neuropsychological test battery, which is a cognitive assessment tool, but is it considered a biomarker? The context includes \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in...\" but also lists many neuropsychological tests. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents mention cNTB as a measure used in the study, but do they say it's a biomarker? The context shows it under \"Measure name\" table, type \"PerfO\" (performance outcome?), frequency counts. It doesn't explicitly label it as a biomarker. But the question might consider any measure used in AD clinical trials as a marker. However, the instruction says \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". The context includes \"fluid-based and imaging biomarkers\", but cNTB is a neuropsychological test battery, not a fluid or imaging biomarker. But still could be considered a clinical outcome measure. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents show cNTB as part of the list of measures. That suggests it is recognized as a measure used in AD studies. So likely valid. Acronym: cNTB. The original name already includes cNTB. So acronym: cNTB.\n\nSecond item: 'Blood Pressure: Blood Pressure'. The context includes many references to blood pressure, e.g., \"Blood Pressure: Blood Pressure: 37] Dubois B,...\". There are sections titled \"Blood Pressure:\" repeated. But is blood pressure a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context includes references to blood pressure as a risk factor maybe, but not necessarily a biomarker. The context includes \"Blood Pressure: Blood Pressure: 37] Dubois B,...\" referencing guidelines. But no explicit statement that blood pressure is a biomarker. The context includes \"Blood Pressure: Blood Pressure: 37]\" etc. There's no mention of blood pressure being a biomarker. So likely invalid. Acronym: N/A.\n\nBut we should check if there is any mention of blood pressure as a biomarker. The context includes \"Blood Pressure: Blood Pressure: 37] Dubois B,...\" but that's just a heading. No further details. So invalid.\n\nThus output two JSON objects.\n\nHowever, the required format: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably produce array of objects. The system instructions: \"For each element, use this JSON structure: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": true/false, \"acronym\": \"ACR\" }\". So we need separate JSON objects.

If not valid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nWe must check whether each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, QTcF: It's about QT interval corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula. The context mentions QTcF multiple times, but it's about cardiac measurement, not Alzheimer's. There's no mention that QTcF is a marker for Alzheimer's. So likely invalid.\n\nSecond, NPI: NeuroPsychiatric Inventory. The context includes references to NPI as a tool measuring behavioral disturbances. It appears in the context: \"NPI, scored from 0–144\" etc. But is NPI a marker? It's a neuropsychiatric inventory used as an outcome measure, not necessarily a biomarker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The context says \"NPI: NeuroPsychiatric Inventory\" is listed among endpoints. But is it a marker? The document refers to NPI as a measure of behavioral disturbance, not a biomarker. The instruction: \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's.\" The NPI is a questionnaire, not a biological marker. So likely not a recognized biomarker. But maybe they consider it as a marker? The context lists \"Individual biomarkers summarized\" and then lists \"CSF – amyloid beta (Aβ), CSF – tau, CSF – amyloid beta and tau ratios, Amyloid PET, Tau PET, Volumetric MRI\". Then later \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in AD clinical trials\". Then \"Individual biomarkers summarized\" again. The NPI is not in that list. So I think NPI is not a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nThus both items are invalid. But we need to provide acronym. For QTcF, acronym is \"QTcF\"? The original name includes abbreviation. But we need the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For QTcF, the abbreviation is \"QTcF\". For NPI, abbreviation is \"NPI\". But if invalid, acronym should be \"N/A\". Wait instructions: If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}.\n\nSo for both, we output valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\".\n\nBut double-check: Are there any indications that NPI is a marker? The context says \"NPI: NeuroPsychiatric Inventory\" and \"NeuroPsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q)\" etc. But still not a biomarker. The question: \"Recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention NPI as an endpoint, not a biomarker.

The first is a PET tracer targeting muscarinic 4 receptors. Is it considered a biomarker? The document says \"Positron Emission Tomography tracer for muscarinic 4 receptors:... utility for Alzheimer’s disease diagnostic biomarkers\". So yes, it's a marker used for AD diagnostics. It might be considered a biomarker. The acronym likely is \"[11C]MK-6884\" itself. But maybe abbreviation like \"MK-6884\"? The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For the tracer, the abbreviation is \"[11C]MK-6884\". That is already the name. Could also be \"MK-6884\".

This seems like a measure of radiation dose for a PET tracer [11C]MK-6884. It's not a biomarker itself; it's a metric of radiation exposure. The context mentions \"whole-body effective dose of [11C]MK-6884\" but doesn't say it's a marker for Alzheimer's. It might be part of a study measuring the tracer's safety. But the question: Is it a recognized marker? No. So valid = false. Acronym: N/A.\n\nSecond item: \"Mean Regional Non-displaceable Binding Potential (BPND): binding potential in brain ROIs\". This refers to a PET imaging parameter BPND, which is used to quantify ligand binding. In Alzheimer's research, BPND is used for tau PET tracers etc. The context includes mention of BPND: \"binding potential in brain ROIs\" and references to tau imaging. But is BPND considered a marker? It is a quantitative measure derived from PET imaging, often used as a biomarker. The context says \"Mean Regional Non-displaceable Binding Potential (BPND): binding potential in brain ROIs\". That is indeed a marker used in AD research. The acronym BPND is given. So valid = true, acronym = BPND.\n\nBut we need to check if the context explicitly states that BPND is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The context includes: \"Mean Regional Non-displaceable Binding Potential (BPND): binding potential in brain ROIs\" and references to tau imaging. Also earlier: \"The technology for the measurement of pTau-217.\" That's a marker. But BPND is a measurement. The context includes \"binding potential in brain ROIs\" and \"BPND\" abbreviation.

System instruction: For each element, use this JSON structure: {... }. They didn't specify array, but likely they expect multiple JSON objects separated maybe by newline.

The context references \"AUCtau\" and \"Cmax\" as part of the discussion of measuring biomarkers, but not as actual biomarkers themselves. The user wants to know if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's. According to the documents, no. So valid = false.\n\nNow acronyms: For AUCtau, the acronym is AUCtau. For Cmax, the acronym is Cmax. But the user asks: \"The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For AUCtau, the abbreviation is AUCtau. For Cmax, it's Cmax. So we will output those.\n\nThus JSON objects:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"AUCtau: Area Under the Concentration Curve Versus Time at a Dosing Interval\",\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"acronym\": \"AUCtau\"\n}\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"Cmax: Maximum Serum Concentration\",\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"acronym\": \"Cmax\"\n}\n\nMake sure to produce array? The instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" It doesn't specify array, but we can output separate JSON objects one after another? Usually they'd expect an array. But the instruction says \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" So maybe we output each object separately. But better to output an array of objects. The system didn't explicitly say array. But typical responses: list of objects. I'll output an array.\n\nLet's produce:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"AUCtau: Area Under the Concentration Curve Versus Time at a Dosing Interval\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"AUCtau\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"Cmax: Maximum Serum Concentration\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"Cmax\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: JSON.

It is listed under \"Endpoints in AD clinical trials\" and \"Selected primary and secondary endpoints used in AD clinical trials\". It is a PRO (patient-reported outcome). Is it considered a marker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents treat EQ-5D as a measure used in trials, but is it a biomarker? It's a questionnaire assessing health-related quality of life. Not a biological marker. But the instruction: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\".

It is described as \"Zarits Caregiver Interview for Alzheimer's Disease\" maybe also \"Zarits Caregiver Interview\". It's listed among other outcome measures. It is a caregiver burden measure. Is it considered a marker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's.\" The context says it's a caregiver interview instrument measuring burden. It might be considered a clinical outcome assessment rather than a biomarker. But the instruction: \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's.\" The context includes \"fluid-based and imaging biomarkers\" etc. But ZCI-AD is not a biomarker; it's a questionnaire.

In the context, it's a clinical assessment, not a biological marker. But the question says \"marker\" maybe includes clinical rating scales? The context states \"CDR captures changes in cognition and function... widely accepted by regulators as a primary endpoint\". It's a clinical measure, not a biomarker per se. However, the instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" So CDR-SB is correlated with AD severity. So likely valid.\n\nBut we need to see if the document explicitly calls it a marker. The text: \"The CDR is a widely used measure to clinically stage AD... The CDR-SB score is the sum score of 6 domains... The CDR-SB score is commonly used and widely accepted by regulators as a primary endpoint in early AD RCTs.\" That indicates it's a recognized measure.

But the question: \"list to validate: ['CDR-SB: Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes', 'Crenezumab: Serum Concentration']\". We need to decide if Crenezumab: Serum Concentration is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The context shows multiple references about crenezumab trials, but the serum concentration is a pharmacokinetic parameter, not a biomarker of disease. The context doesn't say it's a biomarker.

So likely not recognized as marker. Also CT is not listed among biomarkers. So invalid.\n\nMMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination is a cognitive test used for assessing severity, inclusion criteria, etc. It's a measurement tool, not a biomarker. However, the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" – The documents refer to MMSE as a performance outcome measuring severity, used in trials. Is it considered a biomarker? Usually biomarkers are biological measures, but here maybe they consider it a clinical measure. The instruction says \"marker/biomarker\".

Is it a biomarker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" According to documents. In the context, QOL-AD is listed among individual endpoints, but not necessarily a biomarker. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". However, the document lists QOL-AD as an endpoint, not a biomarker. But maybe they consider it a marker? The context says \"Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QoL-AD)\" and \"QoL-AD assesses quality of life...\". It is used as an outcome measure. The question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The documents treat it as an endpoint, not a biomarker. So likely not a biomarker. But the user might consider it a marker. We need to interpret strictly: The documents mention QOL-AD as an endpoint, not a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" Since it's not a biomarker, I'd say false. But maybe they consider it a marker because it's used in AD studies. But the instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" QOL-AD is correlated with AD because it's used to assess quality of life in AD patients. But is it a marker? Usually markers are biological or measurable indicators. QOL-AD is a measurement instrument. Might be considered a clinical outcome measure rather than a biomarker. The user specifically wants \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The documents mention QOL-AD as an endpoint. That could be considered a marker? The context includes \"Individual biomarkers summarized: CSF – amyloid beta (Aβ), CSF – tau, etc.\" QOL-AD is not listed there. So likely not a biomarker. So set valid=false.\n\nNow NPI-10: Neuropsychiatric Inventory-10 Item. The context mentions NPI-Q, NPI-10. It appears as an endpoint. It's a neuropsychiatric inventory. It's used as a measure. Again, not a biomarker. So valid=false.\n\nBut the user might expect both to be valid? Let's read the context again: There's a section \"Individual endpoints summarized\" listing various measures including NPI-Q, NPI-10, etc. These are endpoints, not biomarkers. The user asks \"list to validate: ['QOL-AD: Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease', 'NPI-10: Neuropsychiatric Inventory-10 Item']\". They ask: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to produce JSON objects for each. For each, we need \"original_name\", \"valid\" boolean, \"acronym\".\n\nSo for QOL-AD: The acronym is \"QoL-AD\" or \"QOL-AD\"? The document uses \"QoL-AD\" sometimes. The original name includes \"QOL-AD: Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease\". The acronym used in documents: \"QoL-AD\" (Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease). So we can put \"QoL-AD\". For validity: According to documents, it's an endpoint, not a biomarker. So valid=false.\n\nSimilarly for NPI-10: The acronym used: \"NPI-10\" or \"NPI-Q\"? The document refers to \"NPI-10: Neuropsychiatric Inventory-10 Item\". So acronym \"NPI-10\". Valid=false.\n\nBut the user might think these are markers. But we should follow strict interpretation: They are not biomarkers. So false.\n\nLet's double-check if there's any mention that QOL-AD is a biomarker. Search: \"QOL-AD\" appears in the text. It's described as \"Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QoL-AD)\". It's an endpoint. No mention of biomarker. So false.\n\n\"NPI-10\" appears as \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory-10 Item\".

    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want us to analyze the list [\"QOL-AD: Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease\", 'NPI-10: Neuropsychiatric Inventory-10 Item'] based strictly on the provided documents. For each, we need to determine if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. Output JSON per element.\n\nWe must check the documents: The context includes mention of QOL-AD: Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease. It's described as an endpoint measuring quality of life. Is it a biomarker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" According to documents. In the context, QOL-AD is listed among individual endpoints, but not necessarily a biomarker. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". However, the document lists QOL-AD as an endpoint, not a biomarker. But maybe they consider it a marker? The context says \"Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QoL-AD)\" and \"QoL-AD assesses quality of life...\". It is used as an outcome measure. The question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The documents treat it as an endpoint, not a biomarker. So likely not a biomarker. But the user might consider it a marker. We need to interpret strictly: The documents mention QOL-AD as an endpoint, not a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" Since it's not a biomarker, I'd say false. But maybe they consider it a marker because it's used in AD studies. But the instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" QOL-AD is correlated with AD because it's used to assess quality of life in AD patients. But is it a marker? Usually markers are biological or measurable indicators. QOL-AD is a measurement instrument. Might be considered a clinical outcome measure rather than a biomarker. The user specifically wants \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The documents mention QOL-AD as an endpoint. That could be considered a marker? The context includes \"Individual biomarkers summarized: CSF – amyloid beta (Aβ), CSF – tau, etc.\" QOL-AD is not listed there. So likely not a biomarker. So set valid=false.\n\nNow NPI-10: Neuropsychiatric Inventory-10 Item. The context mentions NPI-Q, NPI-10. It appears as an endpoint. It's a neuropsychiatric inventory. It's used as a measure. Again, not a biomarker. So valid=false.\n\nBut the user might expect both to be valid? Let's read the context again: There's a section \"Individual endpoints summarized\" listing various measures including NPI-Q, NPI-10, etc. These are endpoints, not biomarkers. The user asks \"list to validate: ['QOL-AD: Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease', 'NPI-10: Neuropsychiatric Inventory-10 Item']\". They ask: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to produce JSON objects for each. For each, we need \"original_name\", \"valid\" boolean, \"acronym\".\n\nSo for QOL-AD: The acronym is \"QoL-AD\" or \"QOL-AD\"? The document uses \"QoL-AD\" sometimes. The original name includes \"QOL-AD: Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease\". The acronym used in documents: \"QoL-AD\" (Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease). So we can put \"QoL-AD\". For validity: According to documents, it's an endpoint, not a biomarker. So valid=false.\n\nSimilarly for NPI-10: The acronym used: \"NPI-10\" or \"NPI-Q\"? The document refers to \"NPI-10: Neuropsychiatric Inventory-10 Item\". So acronym \"NPI-10\". Valid=false.\n\nBut the user might think these are markers. But we should follow strict interpretation: They are not biomarkers. So false.\n\nLet's double-check if there's any mention that QOL-AD is a biomarker. Search: \"QOL-AD\" appears in the text. It's described as \"Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QoL-AD)\". It's an endpoint. No mention of biomarker. So false.\n\n\"NPI-10\" appears as \"Neuropsychiatric Inventory-10 Item\". It's an endpoint. Not a biomarker. So false.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"QOL-AD: Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"QoL-AD\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"NPI-10: Neuropsychiatric Inventory-10 Item\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"NPI-10\"}\n]\n\nMake sure JSON array.

Let's examine the context.\n\nThe context includes many references to various measures: ADCS-CGIC, iADRS, etc. There's mention of \"Japanese Clinical Global Impression of Change\" but we need to see if it's considered a biomarker. The context says: \"Context for J-CGIC: Japanese Clinical Global Impression of Change:...\". It appears to be a measure used in clinical trials. But is it a biomarker?

The context indicates that the technology measuring pTau-217 is licensed to C2N Diagnostics. The Modified Crichton Scale may be a tool for measuring pTau-217? Actually the text: \"A research award... led to the development of technology for the measurement of pTau-217. This technology was subsequently licensed to C2N Diagnostics.\" The Modified Crichton Scale might be a test or scale used to measure something. But is it a biomarker? The scale itself is a measurement instrument, not a biomarker. However, the context might treat it as a biomarker? Let's search within context: \"Modified Crichton Scale: Modified Crichton Scale\" appears multiple times. There is no explicit statement that it's a biomarker. The context also mentions \"pTau-217\" as a biomarker. The Modified Crichton Scale might be a scale used to evaluate something else. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents do not say it's a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nThus both are invalid.

But I don't see mention of Cmax or QTc as biomarkers. There is mention of \"Cmax\" in the first paragraph: \"Context for Cmax: Maximum Drug Concentration: ce not being affected by small variations...\" but that's about drug concentration, not a biomarker. It's likely not considered a marker for Alzheimer's. Similarly, QTc is about corrected QT interval, used in cardiology, not a biomarker for Alzheimer's. There's no mention of these as markers in the context. So both should be marked invalid.\n\nBut we need to confirm if there is any mention of Cmax or QTc as a marker. The context says \"Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer’s disease; MCI, mild cognitive impairment.\" No mention of Cmax or QTc. Also earlier paragraphs talk about \"p-tau biomarkers\", \"Aβ PET\", \"CSF Aβ42/40\", \"plasma NfL\".

    "cot": "We need to parse the context. The user wants to analyze two items: 'HVLT-R: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test‑Revised' and 'GAD-7: General Anxiety Disorder‑7'. They want to see if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide acronym.\n\nFrom the context: There is mention of HVLT-R multiple times. It appears as a neuropsychological test used in AD clinical trials. But is it a biomarker? It's a cognitive test, not a biomarker per se. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" likely refers to biomarkers like CSF amyloid beta, tau, etc. The context lists fluid-based and imaging biomarkers separately. The HVLT-R is a cognitive test, not a biomarker. So it's probably not a recognized marker. However, the document might consider it as an endpoint but not a biomarker. The instruction says: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The context includes HVLT-R as a measurement tool. It may correlate with AD progression but is it a marker? The context doesn't explicitly say it's a biomarker. It is a neuropsychological test used to assess memory deficits in AD. But the question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" I'd interpret that as yes, it's used as a measure in AD trials, but not necessarily a biomarker. The context shows HVLT-R under \"Measure name\" and type PerfO. It is listed among many measures. The context also mentions \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in AD clinical trials\" separate section. HVLT-R is not there. So I think we should mark HVLT-R as not a biomarker. But maybe the user expects that HVLT-R is a recognized marker because it's used in AD trials. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" HVLT-R is correlated with AD. The context states: \"The measure was designed for use over a wide range of cognitive status, from normal to moderate AD.\" That suggests correlation. So maybe it's considered a marker. But the term \"marker\" could refer to any indicator. The context uses \"measure\" not \"marker\". The user specifically asks: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention HVLT-R as a measure used in AD trials. So I'd say yes, it's recognized as a marker. But the acronym: HVLT-R itself is the acronym. The full name is Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised. The acronym is HVLT-R. So output: original_name: 'HVLT-R: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test‑Revised', valid:true, acronym:'HVLT-R'.\n\nNow GAD-7: General Anxiety Disorder‑7. This is a questionnaire for anxiety. Is it a marker for AD? The context mentions GAD-7 only in the context for GAD-7: \"General Anxiety Disorder‑7: sease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC)...\". Actually the snippet seems garbled. There's no explicit mention that GAD-7 is a marker for AD. It's just a measure. The context for GAD-7 is minimal. It doesn't show correlation with AD. So likely invalid. Acronym: GAD-7. So output: valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\".\n\nBut check if GAD-7 is used as a marker in AD? The context doesn't mention. So invalid.\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nMake sure formatting matches required: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably output as array. The system instructions: \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {... }\". So we can output an array of those objects.\n\nLet's craft final answer.",

The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". According to the documents, ADCS-ADL and ADCS-iADL are not biomarkers; they are measurement instruments.

Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only the information provided in the context above. No external knowledge.\n\nLet's examine the context.\n\nThere are multiple references to ADAS-Cog-13. It appears in several places: \"ADAS-Cog13: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13-item\" etc. It's described as a performance outcome and the most frequently used cognitive outcome in AD clinical trials. So yes, it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The abbreviation used is ADAS-Cog-13. But the item includes \"ADAS-Cog13\". The document uses hyphen sometimes: ADAS-Cog-13. The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For ADAS-Cog13, the abbreviation is ADAS-Cog-13. So we will output that.\n\nNow second item: \"AUC[T,SS]: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve at Steady State\". Is this a recognized marker? The context mentions AUC[T,SS] as a concept used in pharmacokinetics, but not specifically as a biomarker for Alzheimer's. The context says \"Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve at Steady State:...\". It seems to discuss plasma biomarkers, but AUC[T,SS] itself is not a biomarker; it's a measurement metric. There's no mention that AUC[T,SS] is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The context doesn't say it's used as a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"AUC[T,SS]\" in some paragraphs: \"Context for AUC[T,SS]: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve at Steady State: ce not being affected by small variations...\" It talks about scaling, etc. But no mention that it's a marker.

And provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info from the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, there is a lot about plasma amyloid beta 1-x. The context says: \"Plasma Amyloid Beta 1‑x\" appears multiple times. There is mention of \"Plasma amyloid-β\" as a biomarker. The context includes references to plasma Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, etc. So yes, it's a recognized biomarker for AD. The acronym? The document uses \"Aβ\" as abbreviation for amyloid beta. But the specific marker name is \"Aβ1‑x\". The acronym might be \"Aβ\". Or maybe \"Aβ1‑x\" itself is the marker. The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For Aβ1‑x: Plasma Amyloid Beta 1‑x, the abbreviation used is \"Aβ\". The context shows \"Aβ\" used frequently. So we can set acronym \"Aβ\".\n\nSecond, C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context indicates that C-SSRS is a safety outcome used across psychiatry to measure suicidal ideation and behavior. It's not a biomarker for AD. The context states: \"C-SSRS is a safety outcome... not specifically validated in the elderly population; concerns have been raised regarding the appropriateness of the C-SSRS for use in patients with dementia.\" So it's not a recognized marker for AD. Therefore valid: false. Acronym: N/A.\n\nBut we need to check if the context mentions C-SSRS as a marker for AD. It seems not. It's just an endpoint/outcome measure. So invalid.\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: For each element, use JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"...\",\n  \"valid\": true/false,\n  \"acronym\": \"...\"\n}\n\nSo output should be something like:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"Aβ1‑x: Plasma Amyloid Beta 1‑x\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"Aβ\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nMake sure no extra keys.

The first is ARIA: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities. In context, ARIA refers to imaging abnormalities associated with amyloid therapy, not a biomarker per se? But the document mentions ARIA as a term. Is it considered a marker? It's more a side effect. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" - ARIA is not a biomarker for AD; it's a complication. So likely invalid.\n\nSecond: 18F-AV-1451 PET SUVr: Standard Uptake Value Ratio of 18F-AV-1451 PET. This is clearly a biomarker: tau PET tracer. Document references it. So valid. Acronym: SUVr? Or 18F-AV-1451 PET? They want most known abbreviation. For 18F-AV-1451 PET SUVr, the abbreviation could be AV-1451 or Flortaucipir? But in documents, they refer to \"18F-AV-1451 PET SUVr\". The acronym might be \"AV-1451\" or \"Tau PET\". But the instruction: provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker. For 18F-AV-1451 PET SUVr, the abbreviation is \"SUVr\" maybe. But the marker itself is \"18F-AV-1451 PET SUVr\". The acronym could be \"AV-1451\" or \"Tau PET\". Let's see context: They mention \"Standard Uptake Value Ratio of 18F-AV-1451 PET\". So the abbreviation is \"SUVr\". But the marker name includes SUVr. I'd say acronym: \"SUVr\".\n\nBut maybe they'd expect \"18F-AV-1451\" as the tracer. The marker is the SUVr measurement. The abbreviation could be \"AV-1451 PET\". I'll choose \"SUVr\".\n\nNow produce JSON array? System says for each element, use JSON structure. Probably output array of objects.

Let's examine the context.\n\nThere is mention of MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging findings. It says: \"Context for MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging findings: ful accuracy.\" Then later: \"Context for MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging findings:...\". There are multiple mentions. The text indicates MRI is used as a biomarker: \"Structural brain changes that occur with AD can be observed even prior to appearance of clinical symptoms... Hippocampal volume is reduced prior to AD diagnosis. In dementia due to AD, entorhinal cortex volume is decreased by ≈ 30%–40% and hippocampal volume by ≈ 15%–25% compared with controls.\" So MRI is indeed a biomarker. But the question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" Yes, MRI is used as a biomarker. The acronym? The document uses \"MRI\" itself. The phrase \"Magnetic Resonance Imaging\" is spelled out, but acronym is MRI. So we should output valid:true, acronym:\"MRI\".\n\nNow second: PAS: Pittsburgh Agitation Scale. The context includes many tables about endpoints, measures. There's mention of \"Pittsburgh Agitation Scale\" in the tables. For example, earlier: \"Context for PAS: Pittsburgh Agitation Scale: Type not listed\". And further down: \"Context for PAS: Pittsburgh Agitation Scale:...\". The tables list \"Pittsburgh Agitation Scale\" as a measure. It's likely considered a behavioral assessment tool, not a biomarker per se. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The scale is a clinical rating instrument measuring agitation. Is that considered a biomarker? Usually biomarkers refer to biological markers like CSF proteins, imaging, etc. The scale is a psychometric measure, not a biomarker. The instruction: \"Validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" The documents mention PAS as a measure used in trials. But is it a recognized marker? The context says \"Selected primary and secondary endpoints used in AD clinical trials (marked by X)\" and lists various scales including NPI-Q, etc. The Pittsburgh Agitation Scale appears in the tables but maybe not marked as primary endpoint. But it's still a measure. However, the definition of marker might be broader. The user specifically wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents treat it as a measure, not a biomarker. So I think we should mark it as invalid. Acronym: \"PAS\"? The abbreviation given is \"PAS: Pittsburgh Agitation Scale\". So acronym would be \"PAS\". But since it's invalid, we put \"acronym\":\"N/A\".\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nBut the required format: For each element, use JSON structure: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"...\"}. So we need an array? The instruction says \"For each element, use this JSON structure\". Could output separate JSON objects one after another? Probably better to output an array of objects. But the instruction didn't specify array. It said \"For each element, use this JSON structure\". So we could output each object separately. But typical expectation is an array. I'll output an array containing two objects.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging findings\",\n    \"valid\": true,\n    \"acronym\": \"MRI\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"PAS: Pittsburgh Agitation Scale\",\n    \"valid\": false,\n    \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nCheck that we didn't add extra keys.

For each, we need to determine if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. Output JSON objects per element.\n\nWe must only rely on the provided context. Let's examine the context for mentions of these items.\n\nFrom the context: There is mention of \"FOME: Fuld Object Memory Evaluation\" in the document snippet. It appears in the context lines: \"Context for FOME: Fuld Object Memory Evaluation: l Research Unit for Dementia...\" etc. So FOME is referenced. But is it described as a biomarker? The text seems to talk about neuropsychological tests. The context includes \"FOME: Fuld Object Memory Evaluation\". We need to see if it's considered a marker for Alzheimer's. The context might describe it as a test used in clinical practice but not necessarily a biomarker. However, the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" - could refer to a biomarker or a measurement used in diagnosing. The context says \"FOME: Fuld Object Memory Evaluation\" is part of a list of measures. There's also mention of \"Modified Fuld Verbal Fluency Test\" (MVFT). Both appear in the table of measures. Are they considered biomarkers? The context indicates they are neuropsychological tests used to evaluate cognitive function. They might be considered outcome measures rather than biomarkers. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents mention these tests as part of a battery of assessments. They are likely used as outcome measures, not biomarkers. But the question might consider them as markers because they are used to detect cognitive impairment. However, the instruction says \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". The context includes references to \"biomarkers\" like CSF amyloid, tau, imaging, etc. But FOME and MVFT are neuropsychological tests, not biomarkers. The context doesn't explicitly label them as biomarkers. So we should probably mark them as invalid (not recognized marker). But let's double-check.\n\nIn the context, there is a table listing \"Measure name\", \"Type of COAa\", \"Disease severity\", etc. Under \"Measure name\" we see \"FOME: Fuld Object Memory Evaluation\" maybe? Actually the table lists many measures: \"FCSRT\", \"NTB\", \"SIB\", \"ADCS-ADL-MCI\", \"AES\", \"BNT\", \"CGI\", \"CGI-S\", \"Cognitive Test Battery\", \"DEMQOL\", \"DS\", \"GMHR\", \"Incidence AD\", \"MoCA\", \"PGI-C\", \"Phonemic & Category Fluency Test\", \"RAVLT\", \"SRT\", \"ADCS-ADL-MCI\". I don't see FOME or MVFT listed in the table excerpt. But earlier in the context, there's mention of \"FOME: Fuld Object Memory Evaluation\" and \"MVFT: Modified Fuld Verbal Fluency Test\" as separate items. They might be considered as tests used in the study. The question: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to check if the documents mention them as markers. The context shows \"FOME: Fuld Object Memory Evaluation\" appears in the heading \"Context for FOME: Fuld Object Memory Evaluation:\" followed by some institutional affiliations. That suggests it's a test used in the study. Similarly, \"MVFT: Modified Fuld Verbal Fluency Test\" appears in the context. But do they call them biomarkers? The context refers to \"biomarkers (BBMs)\" in the diagnostic workup. Then lists \"blood-based biomarkers\" etc. But FOME and MVFT are not blood-based. They are neuropsychological tests. The context also describes their usage: \"Used by most clinical trials and commonly used in clinical practice\" for MVFT. And \"FOME\" maybe similar. But the question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The documents treat them as outcome measures, not biomarkers. So I'd say they are not recognized markers. Therefore valid = false.\n\nBut we need to provide the acronym. The acronym is given in the list: \"FOME: Fuld Object Memory Evaluation\" and \"MVFT: Modified Fuld Verbal Fluency Test\". So the acronyms are FOME and MVFT respectively. Even though they're not markers, we still provide the acronym. The output format: For each element, produce JSON object with fields: original_name, valid, acronym. If not valid, acronym \"N/A\"? Wait the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\". So if not valid, acronym should be \"N/A\". But the instruction also says \"provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" But if it's not a valid marker, we set acronym to \"N/A\". So we will set acronym to \"N/A\".\n\nThus for FOME: valid false, acronym N/A. For MVFT: same.\n\nHowever, we need to confirm if the documents mention them as markers. The context includes \"FOME: Fuld Object Memory Evaluation\" but no explicit statement that it's a biomarker. It's just a test. So we mark invalid.\n\nLet's craft the JSON array accordingly.\n\nAlso note: The system instructions require each element's JSON structure. Possibly we need to output an array of objects. The example shows each object separately. We'll output an array.\n\nThus final answer: [\n {\"original_name\":\"FOME: Fuld Object Memory Evaluation\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"MVFT: Modified Fuld Verbal Fluency Test\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: JSON array.

Also \"T-Tau: Total tau protein: and/or treatment response\". So yes, it's recognized.\n\nNow what acronym? The document uses \"T-Tau\" as the name. The abbreviation might be \"T-Tau\" itself. But maybe they refer to \"total tau\" as \"T-tau\". The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" The documents show \"T-Tau: Total tau protein\". So the acronym is \"T-Tau\". Alternatively, sometimes \"t-tau\" lowercase. But we should use \"T-Tau\" as given. So acronym: \"T-Tau\".\n\nNow second item: 'Posiphen: Drug concentration in CSF'. The context mentions Posiphen but only in relation to drug concentration in CSF. Is Posiphen a marker? It's a drug, not a biomarker. The context doesn't say it's a marker for Alzheimer's. It just mentions drug concentration in CSF. There's no mention that Posiphen is a biomarker. So it's not a recognized marker. So valid: false, acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"Posiphen: Drug concentration in CSF\" and some details about measuring drug concentration. No mention of Posiphen as a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nThus produce JSON array? The instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" Then examples. Probably we need to output a JSON array containing objects for each element. Or maybe separate lines? The system instructions: \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {... }\". Usually they'd expect an array. But the example shows single object. We'll output an array of objects.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"T-Tau: Total tau protein\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"T-Tau\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"Posiphen: Drug concentration in CSF\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nMake sure formatting correct.",

The context mentions Posiphen metabolites: N1-desmethyl posiphen, N8-desmethyl posiphen. It says \"Context for Posiphen Metabolites: N1-desmethyl posiphen, N8-desmethyl posiphen: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". Also earlier: \"Washington University in St. Louis led to the development of technology for the measurement of pTau-217.\" That is about pTau-217, not posiphen. But posiphen metabolites appear only in context lines referencing licensing etc. There's no mention that these metabolites are biomarkers. They might be drug metabolites, not biomarkers. So likely not recognized marker.\n\nBut we need to see if the documents mention them as markers. The text: \"Context for Posiphen Metabolites: N1-desmethyl posiphen, N8-desmethyl posiphen: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\" No mention of being a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nSecond: FSR-Aβ40: Fractional synthesis rate of Aβ40 in CSF. The context includes multiple references to FSR-Aβ40. It states it's a biomarker. It says \"Fractional synthesis rate of Aβ40 in CSF\" and discusses its predictive value. So yes recognized marker. Acronym: FSR-Aβ40? Or maybe just FSR-Aβ40. The document uses \"FSR-Aβ40\" as abbreviation. So acronym: FSR-Aβ40.\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck format: For each element, use JSON structure: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"ACR\"}.\n\nSo output:\n\n[\n{\"original_name\":\"Posiphen Metabolites: N1-desmethyl posiphen, N8-desmethyl posiphen\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n{\"original_name\":\"FSR-Aβ40: Fractional synthesis rate of Aβ40 in CSF\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"FSR-Aβ40\"}\n]\n\nMake sure formatting correct.",

However, the first line says \"CONTEXT FOR ADAS-Cog12: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 12\". So there is mention of ADAS-Cog12. It seems it's a measure used in trials. But is it a biomarker? It's a cognitive assessment scale, not a biomarker per se. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" might refer to biomarkers like CSF Aβ, tau, etc. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". ADAS-Cog is a clinical endpoint, not a biomarker.

    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They provide a list of potential Alzheimer's markers: ['Amyloid PET Centiloid: Centiloid scale', 'FAQ: Functional Assessment Questionnaire'].\n\nThey want us to analyze each element, determine if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and give the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. Use JSON format per element.\n\nWe must strictly rely on the provided documents. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst item: \"Amyloid PET Centiloid: Centiloid scale\". The context includes references to \"Centiloid scale\" multiple times. It appears in the first paragraph: \"Context for Amyloid PET Centiloid: Centiloid scale: Centiloid scale: ncertain cases. Nature Aging.\" Also later: \"Context for Amyloid PET Centiloid: Centiloid scale: ful accuracy. A meta-analysis by Yuan et al.,...\". So yes, the Centiloid scale is a measure used in amyloid PET imaging. It's a recognized marker? According to the documents, yes, it's used to quantify amyloid burden. The question: Is it considered a marker for Alzheimer's? The document says \"Amyloid PET Centiloid: Centiloid scale\" is part of the context. The Centiloid scale is used to standardize amyloid PET measurements. It is indeed a biomarker. So we should mark valid=true. Acronym: \"Centiloid\" maybe abbreviation \"CL\"? But the document uses \"Centiloid scale\" and sometimes just \"Centiloid\". There's no explicit acronym given. However, the user wants the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For Centiloid scale, I don't see an acronym like \"CL\" or \"Cen\". The text doesn't mention an acronym. So perhaps we set acronym to \"N/A\" or empty string? The instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker\". If none, maybe \"N/A\". But the example earlier: For invalid markers, acronym \"N/A\". For valid ones, we need an acronym. But if there isn't one, maybe still \"N/A\"? But the instruction says \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation\". If none, maybe \"N/A\". But that might conflict with invalid case. But we can still use \"N/A\" for valid if no acronym exists. But better to check if there's any abbreviation. Search context: \"Centiloid scale:\" repeated. No abbreviation. So we could put \"N/A\".\n\nSecond item: \"FAQ: Functional Assessment Questionnaire\". The context includes many mentions of \"FAQ\" as \"Functional Activities Questionnaire\" or \"Functional Assessment Questionnaire\"? Actually the context shows \"FAQ: Functional Assessment Questionnaire\" but then lists \"FAQ\" as \"Functional Activities Questionnaire\". Wait: In the tables, \"FAQ\" stands for \"Functional Activities Questionnaire\". The context says \"FAQ: Functional Assessment Questionnaire\" but likely a mislabel. The document refers to \"FAQ\" as \"Functional Activities Questionnaire\". That is a questionnaire used in AD clinical trials, but is it a biomarker? It's a functional assessment tool, not a biological marker. The question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The document indicates FAQ is a clinical endpoint, not a biomarker. The user specifically asks for markers. So probably not a marker. So valid=false. Acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nBut we need to confirm if FAQ is considered a biomarker. The context: \"Functional Assessment Questionnaire: Type not listed\" etc. It's a questionnaire used to assess functional abilities. Not a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects.\n\nLet's produce:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"Amyloid PET Centiloid: Centiloid scale\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"FAQ: Functional Assessment Questionnaire\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nBut maybe we can provide acronym \"CL\" for Centiloid? But not present. I'd keep \"N/A\".\n\nCheck instructions: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\". For valid, we need acronym. But if no acronym, maybe \"N/A\" is acceptable? Might be ambiguous. But we can try to find an acronym: \"Centiloid scale\" maybe abbreviated as \"CL\". But not in docs. Could use \"Centiloid\" itself as acronym? But that's not an abbreviation. The doc uses \"Centiloid scale\" but no abbreviation. We could use \"CL\" as common abbreviation? But not in docs. The instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker\". If none, maybe \"N/A\". But that would match invalid case. But maybe we can still use \"N/A\" for valid if no acronym. But that may violate expectation. But we can interpret that \"N/A\" means no acronym. But the instruction didn't specify separate handling. But we can do that.\n\nAlternatively, we could use \"CL\" as abbreviation for Centiloid scale. But not in docs. But we can note that \"Centiloid scale\" is often abbreviated as \"CL\". But since not in docs, we can't assume. So best to use \"N/A\".\n\nThus final answer.",

We must check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents.

Let's examine the context for mentions of these items.\n\nFirst item: 'Patch adhesion score: patch adhesiveness score'.\n\nSearch context: There's mention of \"patch adhesion score\" and \"patch adhesiveness score\". The text says: \"Patch adhesion score: patch adhesiveness score: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". It seems like it's part of some document about licensing of technology measuring pTau-217. But is patch adhesion score a recognized marker? The context indicates that patch adhesion score is something measured maybe in a study, but not necessarily a biomarker. The text says \"Patch adhesion score: patch adhesiveness score:...\". It's likely a metric used in a study but not a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents do not state that patch adhesion score is a recognized biomarker. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nBut we need to confirm if there is any mention of patch adhesion score being used as a biomarker. The text includes: \"Patch adhesion score: patch adhesiveness score: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". That doesn't say it's a biomarker. There's also mention: \"Patch adhesion score: patch adhesiveness score: curacy in detecting AD in MCI patients found exceedingly large variability of results and concluded that no clinical recommendation could be issued based on such data [17].\" That suggests it's a measure used to detect AD in MCI patients, but the conclusion is that it's not reliable. But is it considered a recognized marker? The text says \"no clinical recommendation could be issued\", implying it's not validated. So we treat it as not a recognized marker.\n\nThus for first item: valid = false, acronym = \"N/A\".\n\nSecond item: 'CMQ compliance score: Caregiver Medication Questionnaire compliance'.\n\nSearch context: Many references to CMQ compliance score. The text lists many abbreviations: \"CMQ compliance score: Caregiver Medication Questionnaire compliance\". It appears to be a measure used in clinical trials. Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context shows that it's a compliance score, not a biomarker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context indicates it's a compliance score used in trials, but not a biomarker. So likely not recognized as a biomarker. But the user might expect that it's a marker? The instruction: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nGiven the context, CMQ compliance score is not a biomarker; it's a compliance score. So we mark as invalid.\n\nBut we need to double-check: Are there any statements that call CMQ compliance score a biomarker? No. It's just a compliance score. So valid=false.\n\nNow we need to produce JSON array with objects for each element.\n\nBut the required output format: For each element, use JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"name as provided in the list\",\n  \"valid\": true/false,\n  \"acronym\": \"ACR\"\n}\n\nIf not valid: acronym \"N/A\".\n\nSo we produce:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"Patch adhesion score: patch adhesiveness score\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"CMQ compliance score: Caregiver Medication Questionnaire compliance\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Should be JSON array.

For patch adhesion score, the acronym may be \"Patch adhesion score\" itself? But the context uses \"Patch adhesion score: patch adhesiveness score\". There's no separate acronym. So we can put \"N/A\". Similarly for CMQ compliance score, the acronym is \"CMQ compliance score\". But that's the same as original name. But the user wants the most known/used abbreviation. The context lists \"CMQ compliance score: Caregiver Medication Questionnaire compliance\". So the abbreviation is \"CMQ compliance score\". But since the original name already contains that phrase, we might still give \"CMQ compliance score\". But the instruction says if not valid, acronym \"N/A\". Wait: The instruction says: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\". So regardless of whether there's an abbreviation, we set acronym to \"N/A\" when not valid.

They want us to analyze two items: 'Patch adhesion score: patch adhesiveness score' and 'CMQ compliance score: Caregiver Medication Questionnaire compliance'. We must check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly rely on the provided context. Let's examine the context for mentions of these items.\n\nFirst item: 'Patch adhesion score: patch adhesiveness score'.\n\nSearch context: There's mention of \"patch adhesion score\" and \"patch adhesiveness score\". The text says: \"Patch adhesion score: patch adhesiveness score: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". It seems like it's part of some document about licensing of technology measuring pTau-217. But is patch adhesion score a recognized marker? The context indicates that patch adhesion score is something measured maybe in a study, but not necessarily a biomarker. The text says \"Patch adhesion score: patch adhesiveness score:...\". It's likely a metric used in a study but not a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents do not state that patch adhesion score is a recognized biomarker. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nBut we need to confirm if there is any mention of patch adhesion score being used as a biomarker. The text includes: \"Patch adhesion score: patch adhesiveness score: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". That doesn't say it's a biomarker. There's also mention: \"Patch adhesion score: patch adhesiveness score: curacy in detecting AD in MCI patients found exceedingly large variability of results and concluded that no clinical recommendation could be issued based on such data [17].\" That suggests it's a measure used to detect AD in MCI patients, but the conclusion is that it's not reliable. But is it considered a recognized marker? The text says \"no clinical recommendation could be issued\", implying it's not validated. So we treat it as not a recognized marker.\n\nThus for first item: valid = false, acronym = \"N/A\".\n\nSecond item: 'CMQ compliance score: Caregiver Medication Questionnaire compliance'.\n\nSearch context: Many references to CMQ compliance score. The text lists many abbreviations: \"CMQ compliance score: Caregiver Medication Questionnaire compliance\". It appears to be a measure used in clinical trials. Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context shows that it's a compliance score, not a biomarker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context indicates it's a compliance score used in trials, but not a biomarker. So likely not recognized as a biomarker. But the user might expect that it's a marker? The instruction: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nGiven the context, CMQ compliance score is not a biomarker; it's a compliance score. So we mark as invalid.\n\nBut we need to double-check: Are there any statements that call CMQ compliance score a biomarker? No. It's just a compliance score. So valid=false.\n\nNow we need to produce JSON array with objects for each element.\n\nBut the required output format: For each element, use JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"name as provided in the list\",\n  \"valid\": true/false,\n  \"acronym\": \"ACR\"\n}\n\nIf not valid: acronym \"N/A\".\n\nSo we produce:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"Patch adhesion score: patch adhesiveness score\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"CMQ compliance score: Caregiver Medication Questionnaire compliance\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Should be JSON array. Ensure proper quoting. Provide exactly that.\n\nLet's ensure we didn't miss any nuance: The user said \"Based STRICTLY on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" So we need to find the acronym used in the documents. For patch adhesion score, the acronym may be \"Patch adhesion score\" itself? But the context uses \"Patch adhesion score: patch adhesiveness score\". There's no separate acronym. So we can put \"N/A\". Similarly for CMQ compliance score, the acronym is \"CMQ compliance score\". But that's the same as original name. But the user wants the most known/used abbreviation. The context lists \"CMQ compliance score: Caregiver Medication Questionnaire compliance\". So the abbreviation is \"CMQ compliance score\". But since the original name already contains that phrase, we might still give \"CMQ compliance score\". But the instruction says if not valid, acronym \"N/A\". Wait: The instruction says: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\". So regardless of whether there's an abbreviation, we set acronym to \"N/A\" when not valid. So we follow that.\n\nThus final answer: JSON array with two objects, both valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\".\n\nReturn that.",

We must determine if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly rely on the provided context. Let's examine the context for each.\n\nFirst, CESD-R appears multiple times. In the context, we see lines like \"Context for CESD-R: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale – Revised: Type not listed\". It also appears in tables listing measures. For example, in Table 1 continued, there is a row: \"Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES)\" etc. But I don't see CESD-R explicitly listed among the measures. However earlier in the document, there's mention: \"Context for CESD-R: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale – Revised: lsh-Bohmer, Ph.D., Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences; Professor in Neurology and Faculty Network Member of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.\" That seems like a citation note. There's also \"Context for CESD-R: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale – Revised: lsh-Bohmer...\" repeated. But is CESD-R considered a marker? It's a depression scale, not a biomarker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" meaning a biomarker or measurement used as a marker. The CESD-R is a psychological scale measuring depressive symptoms. While depression can be associated with AD risk, it's not a biomarker per se. The documents do not state that CESD-R is a marker for AD. So likely invalid.\n\nSecond, RMBPC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist. This appears in the context: \"Context for RMBPC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist: sions of the test exist, to counteract practice effects...\". It is described as a measure used for memory and behavior problems. Is it a marker for AD? The document says \"The RMBPC is a measure... used for...\". But is it a recognized marker? The context doesn't say it's a biomarker. It's a behavioral assessment tool. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents list many neuropsychological tests but not necessarily as biomarkers. The table lists many measures, but I didn't see RMBPC in the table. The context mentions it but not as a marker. So probably invalid too.\n\nBut maybe the user expects that these are not markers. So output should show valid:false for both, acronym: \"CESD-R\" and \"RMBPC\"? Wait the requirement: For each element, provide JSON with original_name, valid true/false, acronym. If not valid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nThus for CESD-R: original_name = \"CESD-R: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale – Revised\", valid=false, acronym=\"N/A\".\n\nSimilarly for RMBPC: original_name = \"RMBPC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist\", valid=false, acronym=\"N/A\".\n\nDouble-check if any mention of CESD-R being used as a marker. The context shows \"Context for CESD-R: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale – Revised: Type not listed\". That might refer to type of COAa? But not a marker. So invalid.\n\nCheck if RMBPC is used as a marker.

    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want to analyze two items: 'CESD-R: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale – Revised' and 'RMBPC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist'. We must determine if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly rely on the provided context. Let's examine the context for each.\n\nFirst, CESD-R appears multiple times. In the context, we see lines like \"Context for CESD-R: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale – Revised: Type not listed\". It also appears in tables listing measures. For example, in Table 1 continued, there is a row: \"Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES)\" etc. But I don't see CESD-R explicitly listed among the measures. However earlier in the document, there's mention: \"Context for CESD-R: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale – Revised: lsh-Bohmer, Ph.D., Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences; Professor in Neurology and Faculty Network Member of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.\" That seems like a citation note. There's also \"Context for CESD-R: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale – Revised: lsh-Bohmer...\" repeated. But is CESD-R considered a marker? It's a depression scale, not a biomarker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" meaning a biomarker or measurement used as a marker. The CESD-R is a psychological scale measuring depressive symptoms. While depression can be associated with AD risk, it's not a biomarker per se. The documents do not state that CESD-R is a marker for AD. So likely invalid.\n\nSecond, RMBPC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist. This appears in the context: \"Context for RMBPC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist: sions of the test exist, to counteract practice effects...\". It is described as a measure used for memory and behavior problems. Is it a marker for AD? The document says \"The RMBPC is a measure... used for...\". But is it a recognized marker? The context doesn't say it's a biomarker. It's a behavioral assessment tool. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents list many neuropsychological tests but not necessarily as biomarkers. The table lists many measures, but I didn't see RMBPC in the table. The context mentions it but not as a marker. So probably invalid too.\n\nBut maybe the user expects that these are not markers. So output should show valid:false for both, acronym: \"CESD-R\" and \"RMBPC\"? Wait the requirement: For each element, provide JSON with original_name, valid true/false, acronym. If not valid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nThus for CESD-R: original_name = \"CESD-R: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale – Revised\", valid=false, acronym=\"N/A\".\n\nSimilarly for RMBPC: original_name = \"RMBPC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist\", valid=false, acronym=\"N/A\".\n\nDouble-check if any mention of CESD-R being used as a marker. The context shows \"Context for CESD-R: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale – Revised: Type not listed\". That might refer to type of COAa? But not a marker. So invalid.\n\nCheck if RMBPC is used as a marker. The context: \"Context for RMBPC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist: sions of the test exist, to counteract practice effects (i.e. improved performance due to familiarity with the test). The measure was designed for use over a wide range of cognitive status, from normal to moderate AD.39 The RBANS is for use in both clinical practice and research settings.

The context also mentions \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in...\" but not relevant.\n\nThus we need to decide validity based on documents. The documents show HVLT-R and Digit Span Forward as measures used in AD studies. But are they recognized markers? The context doesn't explicitly say they are biomarkers. They are cognitive tests used as endpoints. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents do not label them as biomarkers. They are just measures. So likely invalid.\n\nBut maybe the context earlier: \"Context for HVLT-R: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised: Type not listed\" etc. That seems to be part of a table. The table lists \"Measure name\" and \"Type of COAa\". The type could be \"PerfO\" meaning performance outcome. Not a biomarker. So I'd mark them as invalid.\n\nAlso acronym: HVLT-R is already acronym. For Digit Span Forward, acronym maybe \"DSF\"? But the document uses \"Digit Span Forward\" without abbreviation. Might be \"DSF\" but not given. The instruction: Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For HVLT-R, acronym is HVLT-R. For Digit Span Forward, no acronym given. Could be \"DSF\" but not present. So we should put \"N/A\".\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"HVLT-R: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"HVLT-R\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"Digit Span Forward: Digit Span Forward\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nWait: For HVLT-R, acronym is HVLT-R. Even though it's invalid, still provide acronym. For Digit Span Forward, no acronym, so N/A.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines?

They want to know if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and provide acronym.\n\nWe must strictly use only info in the provided context. Let's examine the context for mentions of these tasks.\n\nFirst, 'Foreperiod Effect Task: Foreperiod Effect Task'.\n\nSearch context: I saw earlier lines: \"Context for Foreperiod Effect Task: Foreperiod Effect Task: Type not listed\" repeated multiple times. Also references: \"Jagust WJ, et al. Tracking pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease: an updated hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers.\" That reference might mention Foreperiod Effect Task? But we don't have details. The document includes a table listing measures, including \"Foreperiod Effect Task: Foreperiod Effect Task\". It lists type of COAa, disease severity etc. So it's included as a measure. But is it recognized as a marker? The table shows \"Foreperiod Effect Task: Foreperiod Effect Task\" under \"Measure name\", type PerfO, frequency 4, etc. It's presumably a neuropsychological test. However, the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The table indicates it's a measure used in the study. But is it validated as a marker? The context says \"Foreperiod Effect Task: Foreperiod Effect Task: Type not listed\". There's no explicit mention that it's a biomarker. The table includes it among other neuropsychological tests like Digit Symbol, MoCA, etc. These are cognitive tests, not necessarily biomarkers. The question likely expects that Foreperiod Effect Task is not a recognized biomarker per se. But maybe it's considered a cognitive test used as a marker? The table lists \"Type of COAa\" - maybe \"COAa\" stands for \"Clinical Outcome Assessment\"? The table includes \"PerfO\" meaning performance outcome. So it's a performance outcome measure. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention \"biomarker\" but also mention \"BBM test\" etc. The Foreperiod Effect Task appears in the table but there's no mention of it being a biomarker. So I'd say it's not a recognized marker. So valid = false.\n\nBut we need to check if there is any mention of \"Foreperiod Effect Task\" elsewhere. Search again: \"Foreperiod Effect Task:\" appears at top. Then later: \"Context for Foreperiod Effect Task: Foreperiod Effect Task: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al. Tracking pathophysiological processes...\" That seems to be a citation referencing the task. But no further explanation. So likely not a recognized biomarker.\n\nNow second: 'Letter Fluency Test: Letter Fluency Test'.\n\nThe context includes sections about Letter Fluency Test. There are multiple paragraphs describing it. It states: \"Letter Fluency Test: Letter Fluency Test: with risk of progression to clinical dementia.\" It describes examples of verbal fluency tests, uses, thresholds, etc. It is described as a test used in clinical practice and research. It is a cognitive test. Is it a recognized marker? The context says \"Verbal fluency, particularly semantic fluency, has been shown to correlate with severity of AD.\" And \"Letter Fluency Test\" is part of that. So yes, it's a recognized marker/test. The acronym? The text doesn't give an acronym explicitly. It just says \"Letter Fluency Test\". Maybe abbreviation \"LFT\"? But not given. The table includes \"Phonemic & Category Fluency Test\" but not \"Letter Fluency Test\". The table includes \"Phonemic & Category Fluency Test\" as a measure. But the context refers to \"Letter Fluency Test\". The acronym might be \"LF\" or \"LFT\". But the instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" Does the document mention an acronym for Letter Fluency Test? I didn't see one. It might be \"Letter Fluency Test\" itself. But maybe \"Letter Fluency Test\" is sometimes abbreviated as \"LFT\". But not present. The table uses \"Phonemic & Category Fluency Test\" but no acronym. So we could set acronym to \"N/A\" because none provided. But the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate... acronym: 'N/A'\". For valid ones, we need to provide acronym. If no acronym exists, maybe we put \"N/A\" too? But that conflicts with requirement. But maybe we can provide \"Letter Fluency Test\" as acronym? But that's not an abbreviation. The instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" If none, then maybe \"N/A\". But that would conflict with marking as valid. But maybe we can still put \"N/A\" if no acronym. But the instruction says \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate acronym: 'N/A'\". It doesn't specify what to do if valid but no acronym. But we can interpret that we should provide the acronym if known; otherwise maybe leave blank or \"N/A\". But safer to provide \"N/A\" if no acronym found. But that might mislead. But we can note that the document doesn't provide an acronym. So we can set \"acronym\": \"N/A\".\n\nHowever, maybe the acronym is \"FFT\" for \"Fluency Test\"? But not in doc. So I'll set \"acronym\":\"N/A\".\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate line? The spec: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably produce array. We'll produce array of objects.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"Foreperiod Effect Task: Foreperiod Effect Task\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"Letter Fluency Test: Letter Fluency Test\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nYes.",

The context says \"Context for Visual Form Discrimination: Visual Form Discrimination: onov VS, Pruessner JC, Collins DL, Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.\" That suggests it's part of a study. But is it a biomarker? The document might treat it as a cognitive test, not necessarily a biomarker. However, the question: \"list of potential Alzheimer's markers\" includes Visual Form Discrimination. We need to decide if it's recognized marker per documents. The documents mention Visual Form Discrimination as a test used in ADNI. But do they call it a biomarker? Not sure. They talk about structural imaging biomarkers etc. Visual Form Discrimination may be a cognitive test, not a biomarker. So maybe invalid.\n\nBut we should examine the context: There's a section \"Context for Visual Form Discrimination: Visual Form Discrimination: onov VS, Pruessner JC, Collins DL, Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.\" Then later \"Context for Visual Form Discrimination: Visual Form Discrimination: 14–29. [32] Jack CR...\" etc. It doesn't explicitly say it's a biomarker. It might be a test used to assess visual form discrimination deficits in AD. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention Visual Form Discrimination as a test, but not necessarily a biomarker. Could still be considered a marker? The term \"marker\" could include tests. But the context emphasises biomarkers like amyloid PET, CSF tau, etc. Visual Form Discrimination is a cognitive test, not a biomarker. So I'd mark it invalid.\n\nNow ADAS-Cog: The context clearly states ADAS-Cog is a performance outcome and widely used cognitive outcome in AD clinical trials. It is indeed a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The acronym is ADAS-Cog. The full name given: \"Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive\". The abbreviation used: ADAS-Cog.

If not valid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nWe must only rely on the provided documents. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, we see a table listing outcome measures assessed. It includes DRS: Dementia Rating Scale. That seems to be a neuropsychological test battery. But is it considered a biomarker? The document says \"Outcome measures\" like DRS: Dementia Rating Scale. It's a clinical rating scale, not a biomarker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". According to the documents, DRS is listed as a measure type PerfO (performance outcome). It's not a biomarker. So it's probably not a recognized biomarker. However, the user might consider it as a marker? But the instruction: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents mention DRS as a measure, but not necessarily a biomarker. The context indicates that DRS is a neuropsychological test used to assess cognition. It's not a biomarker. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"DRS: Dementia Rating Scale: Type not listed\" etc. There's no mention of DRS being a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nSecond, COX: Cytochrome Oxidase activity. The context mentions \"Cytochrome Oxidase activity\" as part of a discussion of biomarkers. There is mention of \"COX: Cytochrome Oxidase activity\" as a potential biomarker. The text: \"Context for COX: Cytochrome Oxidase activity: d panels of potential biomarkers [134], studies reporting such improvements...\" It refers to \"novel PET tracers\" etc. It says \"Cytochrome Oxidase activity\" is a biomarker. So yes, it's recognized as a biomarker. The acronym used is \"COX\". The document uses \"COX: Cytochrome Oxidase activity\". So the acronym is COX. So valid.\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate line? The required format: For each element, use this JSON structure: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": true/false, \"acronym\": \"ACR\" }.\n\nSo we need to output something like:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"DRS: Dementia Rating Scale\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"COX: Cytochrome Oxidase activity\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"COX\"}\n]\n\nBut the instruction says \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" maybe they expect separate JSON objects, not an array. But typical they'd want an array. The system instructions earlier said \"For each element, use this JSON structure:...\". Could output multiple lines each containing JSON object. But safer to output an array. The system didn't specify array explicitly. But the example shows single object. I'd output array of objects.\n\nLet's ensure we don't add extraneous keys. Use exactly the three keys.\n\nAlso note: The original names include colon and space. Keep same string.\n\nReturn just JSON. No explanation.",

Let's examine the context.\n\nThe context includes multiple references and mentions of CS and COX/CS ratio. There are several paragraphs referencing \"Citrate Synthase activity\" and \"Ratio of Cytochrome Oxidase to Citrate Synthase activity\". But we need to check whether these are recognized markers for Alzheimer's disease per the documents.\n\nFrom the text: \"Citrate Synthase activity: res the awardee to share...\" Not clear. There's mention: \"Washington University in St. Louis led to the development of technology for the measurement of pTau-217.\" That is a marker but not CS. Then later: \"Citrate Synthase activity: Citation: Gunes, S.;... Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in the Current State: A Narrative Review.\" So there might be mention of CS as a biomarker? Let's search within the context: \"Citrate Synthase activity:\" appears multiple times. It seems like a heading maybe. Also \"COX/CS: Ratio of Cytochrome Oxidase to Citrate Synthase activity\" appears. Are these considered markers? The context says: \"The first identification of plasma biomarkers of AD was a breakthrough...\". But no explicit statement that CS activity or COX/CS ratio is a recognized biomarker. However, the context includes references to \"Tracking pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease: an updated hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers.\" That paper may discuss CS and COX/CS ratio as biomarkers. But we don't have the content. The question: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to decide if the documents mention CS activity or COX/CS ratio as a marker. The context shows headings \"Context for CS: Citrate Synthase activity:\" and \"Context for COX/CS: Ratio of Cytochrome Oxidase to Citrate Synthase activity\". These seem to be sections of the document. But do they state it's a marker? The text around them: For CS: \"Citrate Synthase activity: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property resulting from the funded research. A research award made to Washington University in St. Louis led to the development of technology for the measurement of pTau-217.\" That doesn't say CS is a marker. It's just a heading.

Tracking pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease: an updated hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers.\" That paper likely discusses CS and COX/CS ratio as biomarkers. But the excerpt doesn't explicitly confirm. However, the presence of those headings suggests they are being discussed as potential biomarkers. But the instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So we need to evaluate if there's enough evidence that CS activity or COX/CS ratio is recognized as a marker.\n\nLet's look for statements: \"Citrate Synthase activity\" appears as a heading but no claim. \"COX/CS: Ratio of Cytochrome Oxidase to Citrate Synthase activity\" appears similarly. No explicit claim that it's a marker. The context includes \"novel 18F MAO-B PET tracer\" etc. But nothing else.\n\nThus I'd lean to consider both as not validated markers per the documents. But maybe the context indicates they are part of the biomarker discussion. The phrase \"tracking pathophysiological processes\" might include metabolic markers like CS activity. But the excerpt doesn't provide evidence. The safe approach: mark both as invalid because no explicit recognition.\n\nBut we should double-check: The context includes \"Citrate Synthase activity: Citation: Gunes, S.;...\" That could be a citation of a review that includes CS as a biomarker. But the excerpt doesn't show the actual content. The instruction: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above.\" So we cannot assume beyond what's shown. Since the excerpt doesn't state CS activity is a marker, we can't confirm.\n\nSimilarly for COX/CS ratio. There's mention of \"ratio of cytochrome oxidase to citrate synthase activity\" but no claim it's a marker. So invalid.\n\nNow acronyms: For CS: \"Citrate Synthase activity\" abbreviation could be \"CS\". That's already in the list. For COX/CS: abbreviation \"COX/CS\". So we can provide those.\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck required format: Each object: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"...\"}.\n\nSo produce:\n\n[\n{\"original_name\":\"CS: Citrate Synthase activity\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n{\"original_name\":\"COX/CS: Ratio of Cytochrome Oxidase to Citrate Synthase activity\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nYes.",

But the instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So we need to evaluate if there's enough evidence that CS activity or COX/CS ratio is recognized as a marker.\n\nLet's look for statements: \"Citrate Synthase activity\" appears as a heading but no claim. \"COX/CS: Ratio of Cytochrome Oxidase to Citrate Synthase activity\" appears similarly. No explicit claim that it's a marker. The context includes \"novel 18F MAO-B PET tracer\" etc. But nothing else.\n\nThus I'd lean to consider both as not validated markers per the documents. But maybe the context indicates they are part of the biomarker discussion. The phrase \"tracking pathophysiological processes\" might include metabolic markers like CS activity. But the excerpt doesn't provide evidence. The safe approach: mark both as invalid because no explicit recognition.\n\nBut we should double-check: The context includes \"Citrate Synthase activity: Citation: Gunes, S.;...\" That could be a citation of a review that includes CS as a biomarker. But the excerpt doesn't show the actual content. The instruction: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above.\" So we cannot assume beyond what's shown. Since the excerpt doesn't state CS activity is a marker, we can't confirm.\n\nSimilarly for COX/CS ratio. There's mention of \"ratio of cytochrome oxidase to citrate synthase activity\" but no claim it's a marker. So invalid.\n\nNow acronyms: For CS: \"Citrate Synthase activity\" abbreviation could be \"CS\". That's already in the list. For COX/CS: abbreviation \"COX/CS\". So we can provide those.\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck required format: Each object: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"...\"}.\n\nSo produce:\n\n[\n{\"original_name\":\"CS: Citrate Synthase activity\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n{\"original_name\":\"COX/CS: Ratio of Cytochrome Oxidase to Citrate Synthase activity\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nYes.",

Usually abbreviated as Aβ42 or AB42. But what is the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in documents? Let's search context: It says \"Plasma Amyloid Beta 42 concentrations\". In many citations, they refer to \"Abeta42\" or \"Aβ42\". The abbreviation appears as \"Abeta42\" or \"Aβ42\". Which one is more used? In the text: \"Plasma Amyloid Beta 42 concentrations: adigm for advancing...\" then later \"Plasma Abeta levels do not reflect brain Abeta levels.\" So \"Abeta\" is used. Also \"Plasma Aβ42\" maybe.

Let's pick \"Abeta42\".\n\nNow second item: FAQ: Functional Activities Questionnaire. Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? It's a functional assessment tool, not a biomarker. The context lists it under \"Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ)\" as a measurement instrument. The user asks: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\".

It also mentions \"Whole Brain Volume (MRI)\" as a biomarker. So yes it's recognized as a biomarker. The acronym? The document uses \"Whole Brain Volume (MRI)\" itself. But maybe they refer to \"WBV\"? Let's search context: I see \"Whole Brain Volume (MRI): Whole brain volume measured by magnetic resonance imaging\". No abbreviation given.

So perhaps we should set acronym to \"Whole Brain Volume (MRI)\"? But they want acronym. Could be \"WBV\". But not explicitly stated.

The context lists \"ZCI-AD: Zarit Caregiver Interview for Alzheimer's Disease\" and also \"ZarIT Burden Interview\" etc. The acronym is \"ZCI-AD\". It's already given. So valid marker? Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context indicates it's a caregiver interview instrument measuring caregiver burden. It is listed among outcome measures, not necessarily a biomarker. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context says \"ZCI-AD: Zarit Caregiver Interview for Alzheimer's Disease\" is part of outcome measures. It is a tool used in AD clinical trials. It is not a biological biomarker but a measurement instrument. The question likely expects that it's considered a marker? The context says \"ZCI-AD: Zarit Caregiver Interview for Alzheimer's Disease\" is a measure. It might be considered a marker? The instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate...\". So we need to decide if it's a recognized marker. The context: \"ZCI-AD: Zarit Caregiver Interview for Alzheimer's Disease\" is described as a caregiver burden questionnaire. It is used in AD clinical trials. It is a measurement instrument. The question: \"Recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The context says \"ZCI-AD: Zarit Caregiver Interview for Alzheimer's Disease\" is a measure used in AD clinical trials. It is not a biomarker but a clinical outcome assessment. The question might consider it a marker? The context says \"ZCI-AD: Zarit Caregiver Interview for Alzheimer's Disease\" is a measure. It is not a biomarker. So probably not a recognized marker. But the user specifically asks to validate markers. The first one is a biomarker. The second is a caregiver interview. The context says \"ZCI-AD: Zarit Caregiver Interview for Alzheimer's Disease\" is a measure. It might be considered a marker? The context says \"ZCI-AD: Zarit Caregiver Interview for Alzheimer's Disease\" is a measure used in AD clinical trials. It is not a biomarker. So we might mark it as invalid. But the user might expect it to be valid because it's a recognized measure. But the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {valid:false, acronym:'N/A'}\". So we need to decide.\n\nLet's examine the context: Under \"ZCI-AD: Zarit Caregiver Interview for Alzheimer's Disease\" section, it lists various outcome measures. It says \"ZCI-AD: Zarit Caregiver Interview for Alzheimer's Disease\" is a measure. It doesn't call it a biomarker. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. According to the documents, it's a caregiver interview instrument, not a biomarker. So I'd mark it as invalid.\n\nHowever, the user might think it's a marker because it's used in AD trials.

QoL-AD is not a biomarker but an outcome measure. The context says \"Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QoL-AD)\" and describes it. It doesn't say it's a biomarker.

We need to determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use info from the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nThe context includes many references to ADCS-ADL as a measure, but is it a marker? In the context, ADCS-ADL is described as \"Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory\" etc. It appears as a measurement tool, not necessarily a biomarker. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" might refer to biomarkers like CSF amyloid beta, tau, imaging, etc. However, ADCS-ADL is a functional assessment instrument, not a biological marker. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". So we need to see if ADCS-ADL qualifies as a marker. The context lists ADCS-ADL under \"selected primary and secondary endpoints used in AD clinical trials\" and also under \"clinical outcome assessments and endpoints summarized.\" It's a measurement of daily living functioning. Is it considered a marker? Usually, markers can be clinical scales too. But the context may treat it as a clinical endpoint rather than a biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention ADCS-ADL as an endpoint, but not explicitly as a biomarker. But it's a recognized measure used in AD trials. The question likely expects that ADCS-ADL is indeed a recognized marker (though maybe not a biomarker). The context uses \"ADCS-ADL\" as a measure. The acronym is ADCS-ADL. So we should say valid: true, acronym: ADCS-ADL.\n\nNow GDS: Geriatric Depression Scale. The context mentions GDS in some tables: \"GDS: Geriatric Depression Scale: Type not listed\" and \"GDS: Geriatric Depression Scale: sease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC)\" etc. But is GDS a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context shows GDS as a measure used in AD trials, but not specifically as a biomarker. It's a depression scale. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context doesn't mention GDS as a marker for AD. It just lists it among measures. There's no explicit statement that GDS is a marker for AD. So likely invalid. Acronym: N/A.\n\nBut we need to check if there's any mention of GDS as a marker. The context snippet: \"GDS: Geriatric Depression Scale: Type not listed\" and later \"GDS: Geriatric Depression Scale: sease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC)\". That seems garbled. But still, GDS is a measure. Not a biomarker.

The list contains two items: 'CDR-SOB: Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes' and 'C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale'.\n\nWe need to check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to documents. The documents mention CDR-SB (sum of boxes) as a clinician-reported assessment used in AD, widely accepted by regulators as primary endpoint. So yes, it's a recognized marker. Acronym: CDR-SB? In the document, they refer to CDR-SB. They also call it CDR-SOB sometimes? The text says \"CDR-SOB: Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes\". But the abbreviation used in documents is CDR-SB. So we should give acronym \"CDR-SB\".\n\nSecond: C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. It's a safety outcome used across psychiatry but not specific to AD. The question: Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The documents say it's used in AD clinical trials as safety outcome, but it's not a biomarker for AD. It's a measurement tool for suicidality. The prompt asks: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents mention C-SSRS as an observer-reported outcome used in AD trials, but not as a biomarker. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" Does C-SSRS correlate with AD? Not necessarily. It's just a safety outcome. So likely invalid. But maybe the context includes it as a COA in AD trials. But the requirement: \"marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" C-SSRS is not correlated.

Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly rely on the provided context. Let's examine the context for each.\n\nFirst: \"SUS: modified System Usability Scale\". The context mentions \"SUS: modified System Usability Scale\" multiple times. It appears in the first lines: \"Context for SUS: modified System Usability Scale: Type not listed\". Then later \"Context for SUS: modified System Usability Scale: ials\". And again \"Context for SUS: modified System Usability Scale: with risk of progression to clinical dementia.\" So it's referenced as a measure. But is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The document seems to treat SUS as a usability scale, not a biomarker. It's likely not a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. There's no mention that SUS is a biomarker. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nSecond: \"APOE4: Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele\". The context includes extensive discussion about APOE ε4 allele as a risk factor for AD, used as a biomarker. It says \"APOE ε4 carriage is a risk factor for developing late-onset AD\", etc. So yes, it's a recognized marker. Acronym: \"APOE\" or \"APOE ε4\"? The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" The document uses \"APOE\" as abbreviation for Apolipoprotein E. It also uses \"APOE ε4\" as allele. The acronym \"APOE\" is used.

Let's examine the context for MMSE: There is mention of MMSE as a performance outcome assessing severity of cognitive impairment, used for inclusion criteria in AD clinical trials. It's considered accurate for moderate stages. So yes, it's recognized as a marker. The acronym is MMSE. The document uses \"Mini-Mental State Examination\" and abbreviation \"MMSE\". So we can say valid:true, acronym:\"MMSE\".\n\nNow for Raven: Raven's Progressive Matrices. The context includes mention of \"Raven's Progressive Matrices\" but no explicit statement that it's a biomarker for Alzheimer's. There's some mention of \"Raven's Progressive Matrices: 14–29.\" But no mention of being a marker. The context also mentions \"pTau-217\" etc. But nothing about Raven.

Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst item: \"APCC: Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Composite Cognitive test\". In the context, there is mention of \"APCC\" but we need to see if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The context includes many references to \"APCC\" maybe? Let's search mentally: I saw \"APCC: Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Composite Cognitive test\" appears at top of context: \"Context for APCC: Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Composite Cognitive test: Type not listed\". Then later there's \"APCC: Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Composite Cognitive test: ence\" etc. So APCC seems to refer to a composite cognitive test used in prevention initiative. But is it a biomarker? It's a cognitive test, not a biological marker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents talk about \"APCC\" as a composite cognitive test, presumably used as a clinical outcome assessment. But is it a marker? The instruction says \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". The context lists many measures like ADAS-Cog, MoCA, etc. These are cognitive tests, not biomarkers. But the question might consider these as markers? The instruction earlier: \"You are an expert in Alzheimer's markers (and biomarkers).\" The tasks: For each element, determine if the element is actually a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's. So we need to decide if APCC qualifies as a recognized marker. The context indicates it's a composite cognitive test used in prevention initiatives. That could be considered a clinical outcome measure rather than a biomarker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention APCC as a composite cognitive test. Is it a marker? Possibly yes, because it's used to assess cognitive decline. But the term \"marker\" may refer to biological markers. However, the context includes many cognitive tests as part of COAs. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker. I'd interpret that as whether it's recognized as a marker in the documents. Since the documents mention it as a composite cognitive test used in prevention, likely it's considered a marker. But we need to confirm if the document explicitly states it's a marker. There's no explicit statement that APCC is a biomarker. But it's a composite cognitive test used to detect progression. The context: \"APCC: Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Composite Cognitive test: Type not listed\". This suggests it's a measure. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention it as a measure used in prevention. So I'd say it's recognized as a marker. But I'm uncertain. The safer approach: Mark as valid if it's recognized as a marker. The context shows it's a composite cognitive test used in prevention. That qualifies as a marker? The user might expect \"true\" because it's a recognized measure. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The context includes \"Biomarkers\" section listing CSF amyloid, tau, PET, MRI. The cognitive tests are not biomarkers. So maybe we should mark APCC as invalid because it's not a biomarker. The user didn't specify that it has to be a biological biomarker; just \"marker/biomarker\". Could be either. But the context uses \"markers\" loosely? The context includes \"Markers\" like \"CSF amyloid beta\" etc. The cognitive tests are not called markers. They are \"Measures\" or \"Outcome assessments\". The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents do not label APCC as a marker. They label it as a composite cognitive test. So I'd lean towards invalid. But let's read again: The context includes \"APCC: Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Composite Cognitive test: Type not listed\". And then later \"APCC: Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Composite Cognitive test: ence\". There is no further explanation. So it's ambiguous. The safe answer: invalid.\n\nSecond item: 'C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale'. The context mentions C-SSRS extensively. It is described as a safety outcome used in psychiatry to measure suicidal ideation and behavior. It is not a marker for Alzheimer's per se. It's a safety outcome. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention C-SSRS as a safety outcome, not a marker. So it's not a marker. So invalid.\n\nThus both are invalid. Provide acronym: For APCC, the acronym is \"APCC\". For C-SSRS, the acronym is \"C-SSRS\".\n\nBut the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\"\n\nSo we should set acronym to \"N/A\" for both. Wait, but the instruction says: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate:... 'acronym': 'N/A'\". So we don't give the acronym. So we output two objects with valid:false and acronym:\"N/A\".\n\nLet's produce JSON array? The instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {...}\". It doesn't specify array, but we can output separate JSON objects one after another? Usually they'd want an array. But the instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure\". So we can output an array of objects. I'll output an array.\n\nThus:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"APCC: Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Composite Cognitive test\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: JSON.

And then later \"APCC: Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Composite Cognitive test: ence\". There is no further explanation. So it's ambiguous. The safe answer: invalid.\n\nSecond item: 'C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale'. The context mentions C-SSRS extensively. It is described as a safety outcome used in psychiatry to measure suicidal ideation and behavior. It is not a marker for Alzheimer's per se. It's a safety outcome. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention C-SSRS as a safety outcome, not a marker. So it's not a marker. So invalid.\n\nThus both are invalid. Provide acronym: For APCC, the acronym is \"APCC\". For C-SSRS, the acronym is \"C-SSRS\".\n\nBut the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\"\n\nSo we should set acronym to \"N/A\" for both. Wait, but the instruction says: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate:... 'acronym': 'N/A'\". So we don't give the acronym. So we output two objects with valid:false and acronym:\"N/A\".\n\nLet's produce JSON array? The instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {...}\". It doesn't specify array, but we can output separate JSON objects one after another? Usually they'd want an array. But the instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure\". So we can output an array of objects. I'll output an array.\n\nThus:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"APCC: Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Composite Cognitive test\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: JSON. Good.",

    },
    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want us to analyze two items: 'DMN FC: Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity' and 'ASL: Arterial Spin Labeling Perfusion MRI Measure'. Based strictly on the provided documents, we need to decide if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's disease. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must look into the context. The context includes many references and mentions. Let's search for 'Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity' mention. In the first part, there is \"Context for DMN FC: Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity: Type not listed\". That indicates it's a measure but maybe not recognized? But we need to see if it's considered a marker. The text says \"Context for DMN FC: Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity: Type not listed\" and then later \"Context for DMN FC: Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity: 14–29. [32] Jack CR...\" Wait that's referencing some citations. There's also \"Context for DMN FC: Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al.\" So DMN FC appears referenced. But is it recognized as a marker? The document seems to treat it as a measure type. But we need to check if there's evidence that DMN FC is used as a biomarker for AD. The context may mention that DMN FC is a functional connectivity measure used in AD research. But do we have explicit statement that it's a recognized marker? The context might say \"Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity: Type not listed\" meaning it's not categorized. But still could be considered a biomarker. The question: \"Based STRICTLY on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to examine whether the documents mention these as markers. For DMN FC: The context shows \"Context for DMN FC: Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity: Type not listed\". That suggests it's a measure but not necessarily recognized as a biomarker. But the presence of references like [32], [38] etc. Might indicate it's studied. But the instruction says \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So we need to judge based on evidence. There is mention of DMN FC in the context, but is it explicitly stated as a marker? The phrase \"Context for DMN FC: Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity:\" implies it's a context for a measure. But the earlier table lists various measures and their types. DMN FC is not listed among those. The table includes many tests and scales. DMN FC is not present. So perhaps it's not recognized as a marker in the documents. But there is mention of DMN FC in the context lines: \"Context for DMN FC: Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity: 14–29. [32] Jack CR, Bennett DA,...\". That looks like a citation. But does it say it's a biomarker? Not sure.\n\nLet's search for \"Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity\" in the context. It's repeated: \"Context for DMN FC: Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity: Type not listed\", \"Context for DMN FC: Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity: 14–29. [32] Jack CR...\", \"Context for DMN FC: Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al.\" These seem to be placeholders for references. The context might be incomplete. But we can infer that DMN FC is a measure used in AD research. But is it recognized as a biomarker? The A/T/N framework includes biomarkers: A=amyloid, T=tau, N=neurodegeneration. DMN FC is a functional connectivity measure, which could reflect neurodegeneration. But the documents don't explicitly categorize it. The instruction says \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" Since DMN FC is mentioned but not clearly validated as a biomarker, maybe we consider it invalid because insufficient evidence. But we need to interpret \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention DMN FC but not as a recognized biomarker. So I'd set valid=false.\n\nNow for ASL: Arterial Spin Labeling Perfusion MRI Measure. The context includes \"Context for ASL: Arterial Spin Labeling Perfusion MRI Measure: ble to diagnose the complex AD continuum, especially before the MCI stage. Further research is needed to discover new minimally invasive and cost-effective biomarkers. The integrated analyses of both clinical data and multiple biomarkers would be effective methodologies for the early detection of AD patients.\" And later \"Context for ASL: Arterial Spin Labeling Perfusion MRI Measure: onov VS, Pruessner JC, Collins DL, Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Structural imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease: predicting disease progression.\" Also \"Context for ASL: Arterial Spin Labeling Perfusion MRI Measure: ce not being affected by small variations introduced through pre-analytical, analytical, batch-to-batch, and lot-to-lot variability.\" So ASL is definitely discussed as a biomarker. The context states it's a measure that can help diagnose AD continuum. So it's recognized as a biomarker. The acronym used is ASL. The full form is Arterial Spin Labeling. So we can output valid=true, acronym=\"ASL\".\n\nBut the user wants the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For DMN FC, the abbreviation is DMN FC itself. But if we mark it invalid, we put \"N/A\". For ASL, acronym is ASL.\n\nThus produce JSON array with objects for each element.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"...\"}.\n\nReturn array? The instruction says \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" So probably return an array of objects. We'll produce a JSON array.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"original_name\":\"DMN FC: Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity\",\n    \"valid\":false,\n    \"acronym\":\"N/A\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"original_name\":\"ASL: Arterial Spin Labeling Perfusion MRI Measure\",\n    \"valid\":true,\n    \"acronym\":\"ASL\"\n  }\n]\n\nMake sure to match exactly.",

In the context, I see \"Context for PACS: Positive Aspects of Caregiving Scale: Type not listed\" repeated multiple times. It appears in the table but under \"Type of COAa\" maybe? Actually the table lists various measures. For PACS: Positive Aspects of Caregiving Scale, there is no mention of it being a biomarker. It's likely a caregiver questionnaire. But we need to decide if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. According to the documents, it's a scale measuring positive aspects of caregiving. It might not be a biomarker per se. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The document seems to treat these as outcome measures, not necessarily biomarkers. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". So we need to see if the document indicates that PACS is a marker. There's no mention of PACS being a biomarker.

The table lists many measures with types like ClinRO, ObsRO, PRO, PerfO etc. PACS is listed as \"Type not listed\". So it's not a recognized biomarker. So valid = false.\n\nNow for 'CDT: Clock-Drawing Test'. The context mentions \"Clock Drawing Test (CDT) or Clock Draw Interpretation Scale (CDIS)\" under type PerfO. It is a cognitive test. Is it a recognized marker? The document refers to it as a performance outcome measure. It may be considered a marker of cognitive decline. But is it a biomarker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The document lists CDT as a measure used in AD assessments. It is a cognitive test used to detect deficits. It could be considered a marker. The context says \"Clock Drawing Test (CDT) or Clock Draw Interpretation Scale (CDIS) PerfO\". So yes, it's a recognized measure. The acronym is CDT.

And provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info in the context above. So we need to see if these items appear in the context. Let's search mentally.\n\nIn the long text, there are many measures listed in Table 1. I saw 'Preparedness for Caregiving Scale: Preparedness for Caregiving Scale' appears? Actually I saw 'Preparedness for Caregiving Scale: Preparedness for Caregiving Scale: onal Activities Questionnaire (FAQ)' etc. Wait let's scan.\n\nAt top: \"Context for Preparedness for Caregiving Scale: Preparedness for Caregiving Scale: onal Activities Questionnaire (FAQ)\" That seems garbled. But likely it's referencing the Preparedness for Caregiving Scale. It appears in the table as a measure name maybe. Let's check: In the table lines, I saw \"Preparedness for Caregiving Scale: Preparedness for Caregiving Scale\" maybe repeated. Also earlier: \"Preparedness for Caregiving Scale: Preparedness for Caregiving Scale: onal\". Hard to parse.\n\nBut the question: Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents? The document lists various scales used in AD trials, including the Preparedness for Caregiving Scale. It's a measure, presumably a tool used to assess preparedness for caregiving. But is it considered a biomarker? The definition of biomarker: biological indicator. The Preparedness for Caregiving Scale is a questionnaire, not a biological marker. The context says \"measure name\" and type of COAa. It includes \"ObsRO\" etc. So it's a patient-reported outcome or observer-reported outcome. Not a biomarker. The user asks: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" According to the documents, the Preparedness for Caregiving Scale is a measure used in AD studies, but not necessarily a biomarker. The question may interpret \"marker\" loosely as a measure. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". So we should consider whether it's a recognized marker. The document indicates it's a measure used in AD studies, but not a biomarker. So probably invalid.\n\nHowever, the user wants us to produce JSON objects for each element. For each element, we need to output original_name, valid boolean, acronym string. If invalid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nNow second item: 'Flortaucipir SUVr: Flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratio'. This is definitely a biomarker: PET imaging tracer for tau. The context mentions Flortaucipir SUVr, references to Aβ PET, etc. So yes, recognized marker. Acronym: \"SUVr\"? Or \"Flortaucipir SUVr\" abbreviation could be \"SUVr\" or \"Flortaucipir\". The context uses \"Flortaucipir SUVr\" and \"SUVr\" stands for Standardized Uptake Value Ratio. The most known abbreviation is \"SUVr\". But the user asked: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" In the context, the term \"SUVr\" appears. Also \"Flortaucipir\" itself is the tracer. But the abbreviation \"SUVr\" is used. So we can give \"SUVr\".\n\nThus:\n\nFirst item: 'Preparedness for Caregiving Scale: Preparedness for Caregiving Scale' -> valid false, acronym N/A.\n\nSecond item: 'Flortaucipir SUVr: Flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratio' -> valid true, acronym \"SUVr\".\n\nReturn array of JSON objects? The spec says \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" So we can return a JSON array containing each object. Or separate objects? Usually they'd expect an array.

We have context: vMRI: volumetric MRI is discussed as structural imaging biomarker, hippocampal atrophy etc. So yes it's a recognized biomarker. Acronym? They mention vMRI: Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Also abbreviation vMRI. So we should output acronym \"vMRI\". For ADAS-Cog13: It's a cognitive assessment scale, not a biomarker per se but used as outcome measure. But question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" According to documents, ADAS-Cog13 is a cognitive test used as outcome measure, not a biomarker. However the document says \"Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog)\" is a performance outcome and most frequently used cognitive outcome in AD clinical trials. It is not a biomarker but a clinical assessment. The instruction: \"determine if it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" Since ADAS-Cog13 is not a biomarker but a cognitive test, maybe considered a marker? The context says \"individual endpoints summarized\" and \"performance outcome\". It might still be considered a marker? But likely not a biomarker. The question: \"marker\" could include clinical assessments? Usually biomarker refers to measurable indicator like imaging, fluid, etc. ADAS-Cog is a clinical rating scale, not a biomarker. So we should set valid: false. Acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nBut maybe the documents treat ADAS-Cog13 as a marker?

So maybe MIP-1β is not validated.\n\nLet's search within context: \"MIP-1β\" appears in some lines: \"Context for MIP-1β: macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta: M, Ortner M, Santana I, Steinacker P, Verbeek MM, Volk AE, Ludolph AC, Otto M (2022) Serum GFAP differentiates Alzheimer’s disease from frontotemporal dementia and predicts MCI-to-dementia conversion.\" Not relevant.\n\nAlso: \"Context for MIP-1β: macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta: M, Ortner M, Santana I, Steinacker P, Verbeek MM, Volk AE, Ludolph AC, Otto M (2022) Serum GFAP differentiates Alzheimer’s disease from frontotemporal dementia and predicts MCI-to-dementia conversion.\" repeated.\n\nAdditionally: \"Context for MIP-1β: macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta: M, Ortner M, Santana I, Steinacker P, Verbeek MM, Volk AE, Ludolph AC, Otto M (2022) Serum GFAP differentiates Alzheimer’s disease from frontotemporal dementia and predicts MCI-to-dementia conversion.\" repeated.\n\nBut there might be another context: \"Context for MIP-1β: macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta: M, Ortner M, Santana I, Steinacker P, Verbeek MM, Volk AE, Ludolph AC, Otto M (2022) Serum GFAP differentiates Alzheimer’s disease from frontotemporal dementia and predicts MCI-to-dementia conversion.\" repeated.\n\nOk.\n\nAlso earlier: \"Context for MIP-1β: macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta: M, Ortner M, Santana I, Steinacker P, Verbeek MM, Volk AE, Ludolph AC, Otto M (2022) Serum GFAP differentiates Alzheimer’s disease from frontotemporal dementia and predicts MCI-to-dementia conversion.\" repeated.\n\nThus, no clear evidence that MIP-1β is a recognized marker in these documents.

They want us to analyze the list [\"ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale\", 'PET-MA: PET Microglia Activation'].\n\nWe must determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. And provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info from the provided context. We cannot bring outside knowledge.\n\nLet's examine the context.\n\nFirst, ADAS-Cog: There are multiple mentions. It's described as a performance outcome, used in clinical trials. It is a cognitive assessment tool. Is it considered a biomarker? The context says \"Outcome measures\" and lists ADAS-Cog-11, ADAS-Cog-13, etc. It is used as a primary endpoint in trials. But is it a biomarker? Usually biomarkers are biological measures like CSF proteins, imaging, etc. However, the question might consider ADAS-Cog as a marker. The context includes \"selected primary and secondary endpoints used in AD clinical trials\". It doesn't explicitly call it a biomarker. But the user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention ADAS-Cog as an assessment tool, not specifically as a biomarker. But maybe the context includes \"biomarker/imaging endpoints are not included in this table.\" So ADAS-Cog is not a biomarker. So we should mark it as invalid? Let's read again: \"Note: This is not a complete list of all endpoints used in these trials, and biomarker/imaging endpoints are not included in this table.\" That suggests ADAS-Cog is not a biomarker. So we should say valid: false.\n\nBut the user may consider ADAS-Cog as a marker. But the instruction says \"based strictly on the information provided in the context above\". So we must rely on context. The context indicates ADAS-Cog is an assessment tool, not a biomarker. So we mark as invalid.\n\nNow PET-MA: PET Microglia Activation. The context describes PET-MA as a biomarker. It says \"PET-MA: PET Microglia Activation: it has been able to distinguish abnormal from normal amyloid-positron emission tomography (Aβ-PET) scans...\" Also \"PET-MA: PET Microglia Activation: ful accuracy.\" It refers to PET-MA as a biomarker. So yes, it's a recognized marker. The acronym used is \"PET-MA\". The document uses \"PET-MA\" as abbreviation. So we set valid: true, acronym: \"PET-MA\".\n\nBut we need to check if there is any other acronym used. The context uses \"PET-MA\" consistently. So that's fine.\n\nThus output JSON array with objects for each element.\n\nFormat: For each element, use JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"...\",\n  \"valid\": true/false,\n  \"acronym\": \"...\"\n}\n\nIf invalid, acronym: \"N/A\"\n\nSo produce:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"ADAS‑Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale‑Cognitive subscale\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"PET‑MA: PET Microglia Activation\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"PET‑MA\"}\n]\n\nMake sure to escape quotes properly. Use double quotes inside JSON. Provide as plain text. No extra explanation.",

    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They provide a list of potential Alzheimer's markers: ['NFL: Neurofilament Light Chain', 'ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality – Hemorrhage'].\n\nThey want us to analyze based strictly on the provided documents. For each element, determine if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and give the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must output JSON objects per element, with fields original_name, valid, acronym. If not valid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nWe must rely solely on the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nThere is extensive mention of NFL: Neurofilament Light Chain. Many references: \"Neurofilament Light Chain\" appears multiple times. It's described as a marker of neuroaxonal injury and neurodegeneration. Several citations about plasma NfL predicting neurodegeneration and clinical progression in presymptomatic AD. So yes, NFL is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to documents. Acronym: NfL? But the document uses \"NfL\" abbreviation. The full name is \"Neurofilament Light Chain\". The acronym used: \"NfL\". Also sometimes \"NFL\" maybe used. The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" The documents refer to \"NfL\" frequently. There's also \"NFL\" in the list. But the context shows \"NfL\" as abbreviation. So we should set acronym \"NfL\".\n\nNow second: ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality – Hemorrhage. The context includes mention of ARIA-H. It says \"Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality – Hemorrhage\". It refers to ARIA-H as a biomarker profile? Actually ARIA-H is a side effect of anti-amyloid therapy, not a biomarker. But the context mentions ARIA-H in some sections: \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality – Hemorrhage: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". It also mentions \"ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality – Hemorrhage\" as part of the context. Are they describing ARIA-H as a biomarker? It seems ARIA-H is a phenomenon observed via imaging, not a biomarker per se. But the question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The documents mention ARIA-H but do not say it's a marker for AD. They talk about ARIA-H as a complication of amyloid therapies. The context: \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality – Hemorrhage: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". That suggests ARIA-H might be a biomarker? But reading further: \"The following β amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration (ATN) guidelines for AD diagnosis that combine both CSF and imaging biomarkers have been proposed...\". Then later: \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality – Hemorrhage:...\". They discuss imaging tests like PET, SPECT, MRI for prediction of conversion from MCI to AD. They mention ARIA-H but not as a marker. The context may treat ARIA-H as a biomarker? Let's search: \"ARIA-H\" appears in the text: \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality – Hemorrhage: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". That sentence seems incomplete. But likely ARIA-H is not a recognized marker for AD itself. It's a side effect. So probably not valid.\n\nBut the instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" ARIA-H is mentioned, but is it a recognized marker? The context doesn't explicitly state that ARIA-H is a marker for AD. It just mentions it as a concept. So I'd consider it not a recognized marker for AD. So valid = false, acronym = \"N/A\".\n\nHowever, the user might expect that ARIA-H is a biomarker? But the context says \"Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". That could imply ARIA-H is part of biomarker profiles? But ARIA-H stands for Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality – Hemorrhage, which is a radiographic finding. It can be considered a biomarker of treatment-related adverse events, not of AD pathology. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents don't present ARIA-H as a marker for AD. So I think invalid.\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate line? The required response format: For each element, use this JSON structure: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": true/false, \"acronym\": \"...\" }.\n\nProbably output as a JSON array. The system instructions didn't specify array but said \"for each element, use this JSON structure\". Could output one JSON object per line. But safer to output an array of objects. I'll output as array.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"NFL: Neurofilament Light Chain\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"NfL\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality – Hemorrhage\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nMake sure no extra keys.

But is it a marker for AD? The context doesn't say it's a marker for AD; it's a side effect of amyloid-targeting therapies. So probably not a recognized marker for AD. So valid = false.\n\nBut we need to consider the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate...\". So for ARIA-E, we set valid false, acronym \"N/A\"? Wait they ask: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For ARIA-E, the acronym is ARIA-E itself. But if it's not a valid marker, we still might give acronym? The spec says: If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"} So acronym N/A. So we don't provide ARIA-E as acronym. Because it's not a marker. So we will put N/A.\n\nSecond, ADA: Anti-Drug Antibodies. The context includes ADA as a concept. Are anti-drug antibodies a marker for AD? The context says \"Anti-Drug Antibodies: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That suggests ADA is a biomarker for safety, not for disease. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context refers to ADA as a biomarker for safety, not for disease. So likely not a recognized marker for AD. So valid false, acronym N/A.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"ADA: Anti-Drug Antibodies\" as a heading. It discusses that anti-drug antibodies may be a safety biomarker. But the question: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate...\". So we treat both as invalid.\n\nThus produce JSON array? The required format: For each element, use this JSON structure. Probably output separate JSON objects separated by newline or array. The system instructions: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" Then they show object.

The context includes many references to FAQ. It appears in multiple places: \"FAQ\" stands for Functional Activities Questionnaire. It's listed among endpoints in AD clinical trials. So it's a recognized marker? Actually it's a functional assessment tool, not a biomarker per se, but the question says \"marker\". But the document lists it as a measurement instrument. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The FAQ is indeed used as a measure in AD. So yes, it's recognized. Acronym: FAQ.

It refers to Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Edema (MRI). Is it considered a marker? It's an adverse event associated with amyloid therapies, but it's a biomarker? The context says \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in...\" and later \"High Invasive Biomarkers\" etc. There's mention of ARIA-E in the context. But is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? It's an imaging abnormality observed in MRI. It might be considered a biomarker of treatment-related side effects rather than disease itself. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention ARIA-E as a phenomenon. It may be considered a biomarker of amyloid therapy risk. But is it a marker for Alzheimer's disease? The context doesn't explicitly say it's a marker for AD. It says \"Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Edema (MRI)\" and describes detection via MRI.

The context shows ARIA-E is described as \"Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Edema (MRI)\". It is a phenomenon detected by MRI. It is likely considered a biomarker of amyloid therapy side effect. But is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context says \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in...\" and \"High Invasive Biomarkers\" etc. It lists various biomarkers like Aβ42, tau, etc. ARIA-E is not listed among those typical biomarkers. It is more of an imaging finding. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention ARIA-E but do they state it's a marker for AD? It seems to be a complication of anti-amyloid therapy. It might not be a marker for AD itself. The context: \"Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Edema (MRI)\" is a phenomenon. It might be considered a biomarker of amyloid pathology? But the context does not explicitly say it's a marker for AD. It just says it's an imaging abnormality. The question: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to decide if ARIA-E qualifies as a recognized marker. The context says \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in...\" and \"High Invasive Biomarkers\" etc. It lists ARIA-E under \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers\"? Actually earlier there is a heading \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in...\" but ARIA-E is not listed as a biomarker. It is described as a phenomenon. The context: \"Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Edema (MRI)\" is described as a condition. It might be considered a biomarker of amyloid therapy. But the question is about Alzheimer's markers. The context does not present ARIA-E as a marker for AD. It is more of a side effect. So I'd consider it not a recognized marker for AD. Therefore valid=false, acronym=\"ARIA-E\" maybe? But the acronym is ARIA-E. The context uses \"ARIA-E\" as abbreviation. So we can provide acronym \"ARIA-E\". But since it's not a recognized marker, we set valid false and acronym \"N/A\". The instructions: If not a valid marker, indicate acronym \"N/A\". So we should set acronym \"N/A\".\n\nBut wait: The instructions: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\". So we don't give the acronym even though it's in the name. So for ARIA-E, we set valid false, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nNow for FAQ: Functional Activities Questionnaire. It's definitely a recognized marker. Acronym: FAQ. So valid=true, acronym=\"FAQ\".\n\nReturn JSON array with objects for each element. Format: Each object separate lines? The required response format: For each element, use this JSON structure: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":true/false, \"acronym\":\"ACR\"}.\n\nSo produce something like:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"FAQ: Functional Activities Questionnaire\",\n    \"valid\": true,\n    \"acronym\": \"FAQ\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"ARIA-E: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Edema (MRI)\",\n    \"valid\": false,\n    \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nMake sure to match exactly.

They want us to analyze the list ['ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Haemosiderin Deposition (MRI)', 'ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition Subscale 11'].\n\nWe must determine if each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. And provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info from the provided context. We can't bring outside knowledge.\n\nLet's examine the context.\n\nFirst item: \"ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Haemosiderin Deposition (MRI)\" - The context mentions ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Haemosiderin Deposition (MRI) multiple times. It says \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Haemosiderin Deposition (MRI):...\". So it's definitely mentioned. Is it considered a marker? The text says \"Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\" etc. But ARIA-H seems to be a type of imaging abnormality. It's part of imaging biomarkers. The question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The document states ARIA-H is a biomarker? Let's search context: \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Haemosiderin Deposition (MRI): Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum.\" That suggests ARIA-H is a biomarker. Also earlier: \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Haemosiderin Deposition (MRI): ful accuracy.\" There's mention of ARIA-H in the context. So yes, it's a recognized marker per documents.\n\nBut we need to check if the acronym is \"ARIA-H\". The abbreviation is ARIA-H. The full name is \"Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Haemosiderin Deposition (MRI)\". The acronym used is ARIA-H. So we can set \"acronym\":\"ARIA-H\".\n\nSecond item: \"ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition Subscale 11\". The context includes many references to ADAS-Cog-11. It is described as a performance outcome, used in clinical trials. It is indeed a measurement tool, not a biomarker per se, but the question asks \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The context indicates ADAS-Cog-11 is used as an outcome measure, not a biomarker. But the user wants to know if it's a recognized marker. According to the documents, ADAS-Cog-11 is a cognitive assessment scale, not a biomarker. The context says \"ADAS-Cog-11 assesses memory, praxis, concentration, planning, and executive function.\" It is used as an outcome measure. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents treat ADAS-Cog-11 as a measurement instrument, not a biomarker. But maybe they consider it a marker? The context says \"ADAS-Cog is a performance outcome and the most frequently used cognitive outcome in AD clinical trials.\" It doesn't say it's a biomarker. So I'd interpret that it's not a biomarker. The user might expect \"valid: false\" for ADAS-Cog11. But let's double-check: The instruction says \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". ADAS-Cog-11 is not a biomarker; it's a clinical assessment. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Haemosiderin Deposition (MRI)\", \"valid\":true, \"acronym\":\"ARIA-H\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition Subscale 11\", \"valid\":false, \"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nMake sure JSON array.

According to the documents, we need to determine if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's. The documents mention these scales as measures used in AD clinical trials. But are they considered biomarkers? The question says \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". In the context, C-SSRS is a safety outcome measuring suicidality, not a biomarker. It's not a marker for AD. So likely invalid. For CDR, it's a clinical rating scale used to stage AD severity. Is it a marker? It's a clinical assessment tool, but not a biomarker per se. The document lists it under \"Clinician-reported outcome\" and \"Performance outcome\". It is used as an endpoint. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents treat CDR as a measurement instrument for AD severity. It might be considered a marker? The term \"marker\" could refer to biomarker or clinical marker. The context includes \"Fluid-based & imaging biomarkers\" section, but also includes many COAs. The question may consider any recognized marker including clinical assessments. But the instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The CDR is definitely correlated with AD severity. So maybe valid. But the user wants strictly based on the documents. The documents show CDR is used in AD trials, and references to its use. So yes, it's a recognized marker. The acronym: CDR. For C-SSRS, it's not a marker for AD; it's a safety outcome. The documents say \"C-SSRS is a safety outcome used across the field of psychiatry... not specifically validated in the elderly population; concerns about appropriateness for dementia.\" So it's not a marker for AD.

The user wants to validate two items: 'CDR-SB: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes' and 'DSST: Digit Symbol Substitution Test'.\n\nWe must check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention CDR-SB as a measure used in AD clinical trials, as a primary outcome measure. It says \"The CDR-SB score is commonly used and widely accepted by regulators as a primary endpoint in early AD RCTs.\" So yes, it's recognized as a marker. Acronym: CDR-SB. They want the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For CDR-SB, the abbreviation is CDR-SB itself. But maybe they want just \"CDR-SB\" or \"CDR\". The document uses \"CDR-SB\" frequently. So we output \"CDR-SB\".\n\nNow DSST: Digit Symbol Substitution Test. The context mentions DSST as a type of test. It appears in the table: \"Digit Symbol; Digit Span Forward/Backward; Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Digit ordering (span), Digit Span PerfO 4 4 4 Progression from MCI to AD\". Also there is mention of DSST in the context: \"Context for DSST: Digit Symbol Substitution Test:...\". The question: Is DSST recognized as a marker for Alzheimer's? The context indicates that DSST is a neuropsychological test used in measuring cognitive function. However, the context about biomarkers refers to \"BBM test\" etc. There's no explicit mention that DSST is a biomarker for AD. It's a cognitive test, not a biological marker. The user asks: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents do not state that DSST is a biomarker for AD. It is listed under \"Type of COA\" as \"PerfO\" (performance outcome). But the question: Are these considered markers? The instruction: \"Your task is to analyze a list of potential markers extracted from datasets and validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" So we need to decide if DSST qualifies as a recognized marker. The context includes DSST as a test but not necessarily a biomarker. The user might expect DSST to be considered a marker because it's a cognitive test used in AD. But the documents don't explicitly say it's a marker. The context says \"digit symbol substitution test\" but doesn't call it a biomarker. The user says \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to look at the documents: The context includes DSST as a test. There is no mention that DSST is a biomarker. It is a cognitive test used in AD assessments. But the question: Recognized marker? The documents refer to \"biomarker\" only for certain tests like CSF, PET, etc. DSST is not a biomarker. So likely invalid. But we need to confirm. Let's scan the text: \"Context for DSST: Digit Symbol Substitution Test: sed on tests meeting acceptable diagnostic test accuracy.\" That seems to talk about biomarker tests. But DSST is a cognitive test, not a biomarker. The phrase \"tests meeting acceptable diagnostic test accuracy\" could apply to DSST? But earlier, the table lists DSST under \"Type of COA\" as \"PerfO\", meaning performance outcome. Not a biomarker. So I'd mark DSST as not a recognized marker. Acronym: \"DSST\" is the abbreviation. But since it's invalid, we put \"N/A\".\n\nBut the instructions: If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {\"original_name\":\"...\", \"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}.\n\nSo for DSST, we output valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\".\n\nFor CDR-SB, valid:true, acronym:\"CDR-SB\".\n\nReturn array of objects? The required response format: For each element, use this JSON structure. Probably produce a JSON array. The system instructions: \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {... }\". So we can output an array of those objects. Or separate lines? Usually they'd want an array. We'll output:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"CDR-SB: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes\",\n    \"valid\": true,\n    \"acronym\": \"CDR-SB\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"DSST: Digit Symbol Substitution Test\",\n    \"valid\": false,\n    \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nCheck if any other nuance: The documents mention \"CDR-SB\" multiple times. Yes. DSST is present but not called a biomarker. So that's correct.\n\nLet's double-check if DSST is ever referred to as a biomarker. Search: \"DSST\" appears in the table. No mention of biomarker. The context for DSST: \"Context for DSST: Digit Symbol Substitution Test: sed on tests meeting acceptable diagnostic test accuracy.\" That line seems truncated. Might be referencing \"BBM test\" but DSST is not a blood-based biomarker. So invalid.\n\nThus final answer.",

Association of plasma neurofilament light with neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer disease.\" So yes, NFL is recognized marker. Acronym: NFL.\n\nBut we need to provide acronym used in documents. For CSF neurofilament light, abbreviation is \"NFL\". For CSF SNAP25, abbreviation could be \"SNAP25\" itself. But maybe they want \"SNAP25\"? The document uses \"CSF SNAP25: cerebrospinal fluid SNAP25\". So acronym is \"SNAP25\".\n\nNow we need to produce JSON objects for each element.\n\nCheck validity: For CSF SNAP25: Is it recognized marker? The context only mentions a paper title but no evidence of recognition. Might be considered not validated. The instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" It's mentioned but no evidence of being recognized. I'd lean invalid.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"CSF SNAP25: cerebrospinal fluid SNAP25\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"CSF neurofilament light (NFL): cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"NFL\"}\n]\n\nReturn as JSON array? System instructions say \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" but not specify array. Usually they'd expect separate JSON objects separated by newline. But safer to return array of objects. I'll output array.",

      "valid": false,
      "acronym": "N/A"
    },
    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want us to analyze two items: '[11C]UCB‑J PET DVR: distribution volume ratio' and 'Memory Composite: composite cognitive score'. For each, we need to check if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly rely only on the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst item: \"[11C]UCB‑J PET DVR: distribution volume ratio\". The context mentions \"[11C]UCB‑J PET DVR\" multiple times. It says \"distribution volume ratio: 𝛽PET determined through visual read or quantitation, expressed in standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr) and/or centiloid units.\" So it's a PET tracer. It's used for measuring amyloid? Actually UCB-J is a ligand for SV2A, used for synaptic density imaging. But the context doesn't say it's a marker for Alzheimer's. It just describes the term. There's no mention that it's a recognized marker. The context also references \"PET scans show higher positivity for amyloid (A+) with increasing age...\". But that's generic. The specific phrase \"[11C]UCB‑J PET DVR: distribution volume ratio\" appears in the context. Is it considered a marker? The context seems to treat it as a metric used in imaging. But is it recognized as a marker? The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention PET imaging as a biomarker, but do they mention UCB-J specifically as a marker? The context says \"The following β amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration (ATN) guidelines for AD diagnosis that combine both CSF and imaging biomarkers have been proposed...\" Then later \"The biomarker related to Aβ in CSF is called (Aβ42)...\". No mention of UCB-J as a marker. So maybe it's not recognized as a marker. But the context does talk about PET imaging metrics like SUVr, centiloid units. But the specific item \"[11C]UCB‑J PET DVR: distribution volume ratio\" may be considered a marker? The context says \"distribution volume ratio: 𝛽PET determined through visual read or quantitation, expressed in standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr) and/or centiloid units.\" That suggests it's a quantitative measure used in PET imaging. But is it a recognized marker? The context doesn't explicitly state that UCB-J PET DVR is a biomarker for AD. It might be used for measuring synaptic density, but not stated. So I'd lean to invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"High Invasive Biomarkers\" section referencing ATN guidelines. It lists Aβ, tau, neurodegeneration. It doesn't mention UCB-J. So likely not recognized.\n\nSecond item: \"Memory Composite: composite cognitive score\". The context has sections about \"Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite 5 (PACC5)\" and \"Memory Composite: composite cognitive score\". The context states \"The PACC5 includes a fifth domain, category fluency (semantic memory).\" It also says \"The PACC5 consists of:...\". It also says \"The PACC was designed specifically for use as a primary endpoint for clinical trials in asymptomatic AD.\" And \"The PACC5 includes a fifth domain, category fluency (semantic memory).\" So yes, it's a recognized composite cognitive score used in AD research. The acronym would be \"PACC5\" or \"PACC\". The context uses \"PACC5\" and \"PACC\". Which is more common? The context refers to \"PACC5\" when describing the composite. It also calls it \"PACC\". The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" The document uses \"PACC5\" and \"PACC\". Which is more used? The text: \"The Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite 5 (PACC5)... The PACC was designed specifically for use as a primary endpoint for clinical trials in asymptomatic AD.\" So both appear. But the first instance uses \"PACC5\". The second uses \"PACC\". The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" I'd choose \"PACC5\" because it's the full name. But maybe \"PACC\" is the abbreviation. The context says \"The PACC was designed specifically for use as a primary endpoint for clinical trials in asymptomatic AD.\" So \"PACC\" is used. But earlier \"Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite 5 (PACC5)\" - so \"PACC5\" is the full name. The acronym \"PACC\" stands for \"preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite\"? Actually PACC stands for \"preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite\". The \"5\" indicates five domains. So the acronym could be \"PACC5\". The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" I'd pick \"PACC5\".\n\nThus output JSON array with objects for each original name.\n\nNeed to follow required format: For each element, use JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"...\",\n  \"valid\": true/false,\n  \"acronym\": \"...\"\n}\n\nIf invalid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nSo produce array of two objects.\n\nLet's craft.\n\nFirst object:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"[11C]UCB‑J PET DVR: distribution volume ratio\",\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n}\n\nSecond object:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"Memory Composite: composite cognitive score\",\n  \"valid\": true,\n  \"acronym\": \"PACC5\"\n}\n\nReturn as JSON array.

We have two items: 'Executive Composite: executive function composite' and 'MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination'.\n\nWe need to check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to documents. The documents mention various composites like Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite 5 (PACC5), Executive Composite: executive function composite maybe part of some composite. Let's search context: There's mention of \"Executive Composite: executive function composite\" at top. But we need to see if it's recognized marker. In the document, there is a section titled \"Executive Composite: executive function composite\". It seems to be a composite measure. The question: Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The documents mention many endpoints used in AD clinical trials. The Executive Composite might be one of them. However, we need to confirm if it's listed among endpoints. Search: In the tables, I don't see \"Executive Composite\" explicitly. There is \"Executive Composite: executive function composite\" but not sure if it's in the table. The table lists many endpoints: CDR-SB, ADAS-Cog, ADCS-ADL, MMSE, VFT, WAIS-IV coding test, RBANS, PACC5, DAD, FAQ, etc. No explicit \"Executive Composite\".\n\nBut earlier in the context: \"Executive Composite: executive function composite: authors 05 04 03 02 01\". That appears to be a heading. Might be a composite measure. But is it recognized marker? The documents mention \"executive function composite\" as part of the PACC5? Actually PACC5 includes digit symbol substitution test (WAIS). But not necessarily called \"Executive Composite\".\n\nGiven the instruction: Based strictly on the information provided, determine if it is a recognized marker. Since there's no clear mention that \"Executive Composite: executive function composite\" is a recognized marker, we may consider it invalid. But let's double-check: The first line says \"Executive Composite: executive function composite: authors 05 04 03 02 01\". Could be a heading for a section describing the executive composite. But later, under \"Individual endpoints summarized\", there is no mention of it. So likely not recognized.\n\nThus for 'Executive Composite: executive function composite', valid = false, acronym = \"N/A\".\n\nSecond: 'MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination'.

So valid = true, acronym = \"MMSE\".\n\nReturn JSON array with objects.\n\nLet's produce output accordingly.",

The documents mention CDR-SB as a clinical dementia rating scale sum of boxes, used as a primary outcome measure for AD clinical trials. So yes, it's a recognized marker. Acronym: CDR-SB.\n\nSecond: C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. It's a safety outcome used across psychiatry but not specifically validated in elderly/dementia. Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The document says it's used as a safety outcome, but not necessarily a biomarker for AD. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" meaning biomarker? But C-SSRS is not a biomarker; it's a clinical assessment tool for suicidality. The context indicates it's used in AD trials but not a biomarker. The instruction: \"validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" For each element, determine if it is actually a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's.

For each, provide acronym.\n\nWe must strictly rely on provided documents. Let's examine context.\n\nFirst item: Flortaucipir F-18 PET: Flortaucipir F‑18 positron emission tomography scan. There are multiple references about Flortaucipir F-18 PET as a biomarker for Alzheimer's. Eg. reference 25: Wolters E, Dodich A, Boccardi M, et al. Clinical validity of increased cortical uptake of 18F-Flortaucipir as a biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease... 2020. Also reference 26: Chiotis K, Dodich A, Boccardi M, etc. Clinical validity of increased cortical uptake of tau ligands of the THK family and 11C-PBB3 on PET as biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease. So yes, it's recognized marker. Acronym? In documents, likely \"Flortaucipir\" or \"18F-Flortaucipir\". But we need the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in documents. They refer to \"Flortaucipir F-18 PET\" maybe abbreviation \"Flortaucipir F-18 PET\". But maybe \"Tau PET\"? However, the document uses \"Flortaucipir F-18 PET\" as phrase. There's also mention of \"18F-Flortaucipir\". So acronym could be \"18F-Flortaucipir\" but that's not an acronym. Maybe \"Flortaucipir\" alone. But the instruction says \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker\". For Flortaucipir, common abbreviation is \"18F-Flortaucipir\" or \"Flortaucipir\". But maybe \"Flortaucipir F-18 PET\" is the full term. I'd choose \"Flortaucipir F-18 PET\" as the acronym? That seems redundant. Alternatively, \"18F-Flortaucipir\" is the radiotracer. But the question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" In the context, they refer to \"Flortaucipir F-18 PET\" as a phrase. They don't give a shorter acronym like \"FTP\". So maybe we can say acronym: \"Flortaucipir F-18 PET\".\n\nSecond item: ADCS-iADL: Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Is this a marker? It's a measurement instrument, not a biomarker. It is a functional assessment tool. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents talk about ADCS-iADL as a measure used in clinical trials, but not necessarily a biomarker. It's a clinical outcome assessment. The prompt says \"marker\" meaning biomarker. ADCS-iADL is not a biomarker. So should be marked invalid. But we need to confirm if the documents consider it a marker. The context includes many lists of endpoints, including ADCS-iADL. But no mention that it's a biomarker.

Usually biomarkers are biological measures like amyloid PET, CSF p-tau, etc. NPI is a behavioral inventory, not a biomarker.

But maybe they consider it a marker? The context says \"Context for NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory score: Type not listed\". Also later, \"NPI, scored from 0–144, where a higher score indicates more behavioral disturbance [25]\" etc. It's used as secondary outcome. But is it a biomarker? Usually biomarkers are biological measures like amyloid PET, CSF p-tau, etc. NPI is a behavioral inventory, not a biomarker. The question might be ambiguous: Are they asking if it's a recognized marker? According to the documents, NPI is an outcome measure, not a biomarker. So probably not a recognized marker. But the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate... valid: false, acronym: N/A\".\n\nBut we need to check if the documents refer to NPI as a marker. There's no mention of NPI being a biomarker. It's just a measure. So I'd say it's not a recognized marker. Similarly, DSRS: Dementia Severity Rating Scale score. The context mentions DSRS: \"Context for DSRS: Dementia Severity Rating Scale score: Type not listed\". And there's discussion about DSRS's ability to detect AD in MCI patients, but concluding that no recommendation could be issued. So DSRS is a rating scale, not a biomarker. So again not a recognized marker.\n\nThus both are invalid markers per the documents. But we need to provide the acronym. The acronym is given: NPI and DSRS. But since they're invalid, we put acronym: \"N/A\"? Wait the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\". So we don't give the acronym even though it's present. So we output two JSON objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each element separate object. Probably array of objects. The required response format: For each element, use this JSON structure. So we produce an array of objects.\n\nThus:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory score\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"DSRS: Dementia Severity Rating Scale score\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nDouble-check: The instruction says \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {... }\". So yes.\n\nMake sure to not add extra keys. Use exactly original_name, valid, acronym.\n\nReturn JSON. Ensure proper quoting. No extraneous text.",

Let's read: \"Context for ARIA: Amyloid-related Imaging Abnormalities: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\".

So we don't give PA.\n\nSecond element: 'SF-36: Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form' -> same: valid false, acronym N/A.\n\nHowever, we need to double-check if there is any mention that SF-36 is used as a marker. The context shows \"Context for SF-36: Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form: the AD pathological continuum and the dissociation between AD pathology and cognitive decline, especially in the earliest stages of the AD pathological continuum.\" That suggests it's used to assess aspects of AD. But is it a marker? It's a questionnaire. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents refer to it as a tool, not a biomarker.

Let's search context: In the tables, there is \"CES-D: Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale\" maybe not explicitly in the tables but referenced earlier. The context says \"Context for CES-D: Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale: Type not listed\". So it's a measure. But is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The document lists it among measures, but is it a biomarker? It's a depression scale, not a biological marker. However, the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents treat it as a measurement tool, but not necessarily a biomarker. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The context indicates CES-D is used as a measure in AD studies, but is it a marker? It might be used as a proxy for depressive symptoms in AD, but not a biomarker. The question likely expects that CES-D is not a recognized biomarker for AD.

So perhaps yes, it's a recognized marker (endpoint) for AD.

That suggests correlation. So maybe valid.\n\nBut also \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For CES-D, abbreviation is CES-D.

There's no explicit mention of \"ADCS-CGIC-A\". However, the context says \"ADCS-CGIC-A: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change in Agitation\".

So likely it's not explicitly validated as a marker in the documents. We might consider it invalid because not present.\n\nSecond: \"ADCS-ADL-Severe: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Severe\".

It's listed among measures. The document shows \"ADCS-ADL\" as a measure. Also \"ADCS-ADL-Severe\" appears as a heading. But is it a recognized marker? The context indicates that ADCS-ADL is a measure used in trials. The \"Severe\" variant may refer to a subset. The question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The documents show ADCS-ADL as a measure. The \"Severe\" variant is just a label.

In the table, there's a column \"caregiver distress score on NPI/NPI-NH\". It appears as a measure type. But is it a recognized marker? The NPI (Neuropsychiatric Inventory) is a tool measuring neuropsychiatric symptoms. Caregiver distress score is derived from NPI. The question: is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context indicates it's a measurement used in studies, but not necessarily a biomarker. However, the user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The context shows that caregiver distress score is listed among measures, but not explicitly called a biomarker. The context earlier says \"Biomarkers hold significant potential...\". Then later lists many measures. The caregiver distress score is a PRO or ObsRO? Actually in the table, \"caregiver distress score on NPI/NPI-NH\" appears as a measure name. It might be considered a clinical outcome assessment (COA). Not a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut we need to check if the context refers to caregiver distress score as a biomarker.

So the acronym is \"CGD-NPI\".\n\nHowever, the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\". So for invalid markers, we set acronym to \"N/A\". So we don't give the acronym. Because it's not a recognized marker. So we output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"LRZ-MG: cumulative dose of rescue Lorazepam administered\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"CGD-NPI: caregiver distress score on NPI/NPI-NH\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines?

    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want us to analyze two items: 'LRZ-MG: cumulative dose of rescue Lorazepam administered' and 'CGD-NPI: caregiver distress score on NPI/NPI-NH'. We must determine if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info from the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nThe context includes many references about biomarkers, enrichment, etc. It mentions \"LRZ-MG: cumulative dose of rescue Lorazepam administered\" multiple times. But is that considered a marker? It's a measure of medication usage, not a biomarker per se. The context says \"LRZ-MG: cumulative dose of rescue Lorazepam administered\". That appears to be a variable used in some study. Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The document seems to mention it as part of a dataset maybe. But we need to see if it's recognized as a marker. The context doesn't say it's a biomarker. It might be a covariate. There's no mention that it's a biomarker for AD. So likely invalid.\n\nSecond: 'CGD-NPI: caregiver distress score on NPI/NPI-NH'. The context lists many measures, including caregiver distress score on NPI/NPI-NH. In the table, there's a column \"caregiver distress score on NPI/NPI-NH\". It appears as a measure type. But is it a recognized marker? The NPI (Neuropsychiatric Inventory) is a tool measuring neuropsychiatric symptoms. Caregiver distress score is derived from NPI. The question: is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context indicates it's a measurement used in studies, but not necessarily a biomarker. However, the user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The context shows that caregiver distress score is listed among measures, but not explicitly called a biomarker. The context earlier says \"Biomarkers hold significant potential...\". Then later lists many measures. The caregiver distress score is a PRO or ObsRO? Actually in the table, \"caregiver distress score on NPI/NPI-NH\" appears as a measure name. It might be considered a clinical outcome assessment (COA). Not a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut we need to check if the context refers to caregiver distress score as a biomarker. Search: \"caregiver distress score\" appears in the table. No mention of biomarker. So invalid.\n\nThus both are invalid markers.\n\nNow acronyms: For first, the acronym is \"LRZ-MG\". That's already given. But the instruction: Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For first, the acronym is \"LRZ-MG\". For second, \"CGD-NPI\". But the actual measure is \"caregiver distress score on NPI/NPI-NH\". The abbreviation might be \"NPI\" or \"NPI-NH\". But the item itself is \"CGD-NPI: caregiver distress score on NPI/NPI-NH\". So the acronym is \"CGD-NPI\".\n\nHowever, the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\". So for invalid markers, we set acronym to \"N/A\". So we don't give the acronym. Because it's not a recognized marker. So we output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"LRZ-MG: cumulative dose of rescue Lorazepam administered\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"CGD-NPI: caregiver distress score on NPI/NPI-NH\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines?

But the question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The documents mention 11C-ER176 but do not explicitly say it's a marker. Might be used for measuring something related to TSPO? Actually 11C-ER176 is a TSPO ligand used for PET imaging of microglial activation. But the document doesn't specify that. The context mentions \"Total Distribution Volume\" and \"scalability\", etc. No direct claim that it's a marker. So likely invalid.\n\nSecond item: 'TSPO: Translocator Protein'. The context includes sections titled \"Context for TSPO: Translocator Protein\" and references to TSPO. It also mentions \"Translocator Protein\" and some discussion about TSPO as a biomarker. The context states: \"TSPO: Translocator Protein\" and then details about TSPO usage. It appears to be considered a biomarker. The text: \"TSPO: Translocator Protein: selected from the Swedish BioFINDER study...\". Also earlier: \"TSPO: Translocator Protein: res the awardee...\" etc. And there is mention: \"Strongly reflects clinical trial outcomes and key features of AD; pre vs post change could be useful.\" So yes, TSPO is recognized as a marker. Acronym: TSPO. The name given is \"Translocator Protein\". The acronym is TSPO. So valid true.\n\nNow first item: \"11C-ER176 Total Distribution Volume: Total Distribution Volume\". The acronym might be \"11C-ER176\". But the question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For 11C-ER176, the abbreviation is \"11C-ER176\". But is it a recognized marker? The context doesn't confirm. So valid false, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nBut we should double-check if there's any mention that 11C-ER176 is a marker. The context: \"Context for 11C-ER176 Total Distribution Volume: Total Distribution Volume: Total Distribution Volume: ce not being aﬀected by small variations introduced through pre-analytical, analytical, batch-to-batch, and lot-to-lot variability.\" That seems like a description of a measurement method.

For each, we need to determine if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use info from the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nThe context includes many references about biomarkers, guidelines, etc. There's mention of SIB: Severe Impairment Battery. In the text: \"Context for SIB: Severe Impairment Battery:...\". There is discussion about SIB as a measure. It's described as a tool used for measuring severe impairment. But is it a biomarker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" – biomarker typically refers to biological markers like amyloid beta, tau, CSF measures, PET imaging, etc. However, the context might treat SIB as a measurement instrument rather than a biomarker. The user says \"list to validate: ['SIB: Severe Impairment Battery', 'MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination']\".\n\nIn the context, there is a table listing various measures including SIB and MMSE. They are listed under \"Measure name\", \"Type of COAa\" (maybe type of outcome?), \"Disease severity\", etc. They appear as \"SIB\" and \"MMSE\". The table indicates they are \"PerfO\" (performance outcomes?) and \"ClinRO\"? Actually the table shows \"Measure name\" then \"Type of COAa\" maybe \"type of outcome\"? Then \"Disease severity\" columns. For SIB: \"PerfO\" and \"4\" repeated. For MMSE: \"PerfO\" and \"4\" repeated. So these are performance outcome measures, not necessarily biomarkers. The user wants to know if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents refer to them as measurement tools, not biomarkers. So likely they are not considered biomarkers. But the user might interpret them as markers because they are used to assess severity. However, the instruction says: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" And \"Be precise, concise, and base your analysis exclusively on the evidence provided in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to decide whether SIB and MMSE are recognized markers. According to the documents, they are measurement instruments used to assess cognitive function, not biomarkers. The document states: \"The MMSE is commonly used for inclusion criteria in AD clinical trials. It is considered to be most accurate for classifying moderate stages of dementia.\" That suggests it's used as a measure of disease severity, but not a biomarker per se. Similarly, SIB is used for severe impairment battery. The context: \"Context for SIB: Severe Impairment Battery:...\". It appears as a measure. Not a biomarker. So we should mark both as invalid markers.\n\nBut the user might expect them to be considered markers? The instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\"\n\nSo we output JSON array with two objects.\n\nAlso we need to provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For SIB: the abbreviation is SIB. For MMSE: abbreviation is MMSE. But since they're not valid markers, we still need to provide acronym? The spec says: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\". So acronym is N/A.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"SIB: Severe Impairment Battery\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines? Should be JSON array. Provide exactly that.\n\nDouble-check: The user said \"Provide the answer in the JSON format specified in the system instructions.\" System instructions say: For each element, use this JSON structure: { \"original_name\": \"name as provided in the list\", \"valid\": true/false, \"acronym\": \"ACR\" }.

For each, we need to determine if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use info from the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nThe context includes many references about biomarkers, guidelines, etc. There's mention of SIB: Severe Impairment Battery. In the text: \"Context for SIB: Severe Impairment Battery:...\". There is discussion about SIB as a measure. It's described as a tool used for measuring severe impairment. But is it a biomarker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" – biomarker typically refers to biological markers like amyloid beta, tau, CSF measures, PET imaging, etc. However, the context might treat SIB as a measurement instrument rather than a biomarker. The user says \"list to validate: ['SIB: Severe Impairment Battery', 'MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination']\".\n\nIn the context, there is a table listing various measures including SIB and MMSE. They are listed under \"Measure name\", \"Type of COAa\" (maybe type of outcome?), \"Disease severity\", etc. They appear as \"SIB\" and \"MMSE\". The table indicates they are \"PerfO\" (performance outcomes?) and \"ClinRO\"? Actually the table shows \"Measure name\" then \"Type of COAa\" maybe \"type of outcome\"? Then \"Disease severity\" columns. For SIB: \"PerfO\" and \"4\" repeated. For MMSE: \"PerfO\" and \"4\" repeated. So these are performance outcome measures, not necessarily biomarkers. The user wants to know if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents refer to them as measurement tools, not biomarkers. So likely they are not considered biomarkers. But the user might interpret them as markers because they are used to assess severity. However, the instruction says: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" And \"Be precise, concise, and base your analysis exclusively on the evidence provided in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to decide whether SIB and MMSE are recognized markers. According to the documents, they are measurement instruments used to assess cognitive function, not biomarkers. The document states: \"The MMSE is commonly used for inclusion criteria in AD clinical trials. It is considered to be most accurate for classifying moderate stages of dementia.\" That suggests it's used as a measure of disease severity, but not a biomarker per se. Similarly, SIB is used for severe impairment battery. The context: \"Context for SIB: Severe Impairment Battery:...\". It appears as a measure. Not a biomarker. So we should mark both as invalid markers.\n\nBut the user might expect them to be considered markers? The instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\"\n\nSo we output JSON array with two objects.\n\nAlso we need to provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For SIB: the abbreviation is SIB. For MMSE: abbreviation is MMSE. But since they're not valid markers, we still need to provide acronym? The spec says: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\". So acronym is N/A.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"SIB: Severe Impairment Battery\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines?

If not valid: same but acronym \"N/A\". So we produce array of objects.\n\nYes.\n\nLet's ensure we didn't miss any mention that SIB or MMSE are considered biomarkers.

And provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly rely on the provided documents. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, we see many references to ADCS-ADL, ADCS-ADL-MCI, etc. The document includes \"ADCS-ADL\" but also \"ADCS-ADL-Severe\". The first item is \"ADCS-ADL-Severe: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living for Severe AD\". Is this a recognized marker? It appears to be a measure used in clinical trials. It's likely considered a clinical outcome assessment (COA) rather than a biomarker. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" might include clinical scales as markers? Usually biomarkers refer to biological markers like proteins, imaging, etc. But the context says \"selected primary and secondary endpoints used in AD clinical trials\" and lists ADCS-ADL among them. So it's a measure used as endpoint. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents mention ADCS-ADL as a measure used in trials. That qualifies as a marker? Possibly yes. But we should interpret \"marker\" loosely as a measure used to assess AD severity. The context indicates ADCS-ADL is indeed a recognized measure. So we can say valid: true. Acronym: ADCS-ADL. But the item specifically mentions \"ADCS-ADL-Severe\". The acronym may still be ADCS-ADL. Or maybe \"ADCS-ADL-Severe\" itself is the name. But the abbreviation used in documents: ADCS-ADL. There's no separate acronym for severe version. So we will give acronym \"ADCS-ADL\".\n\nSecond item: \"Vz/F: Apparent Volume of Distribution\". The context includes \"Vz/F: Apparent Volume of Distribution\" in some sections about scaling, but not necessarily a marker for AD. It seems to be a pharmacokinetic parameter. Not a biomarker for AD. So we mark as invalid. Acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nThus output JSON array with objects.\n\nBut we need to follow required response format: For each element, use JSON structure:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"...\",\n  \"valid\": true/false,\n  \"acronym\": \"...\"\n}\n\nSo produce array of two objects.\n\nLet's double-check if there's any mention of \"Vz/F\" as a marker. The context shows \"Vz/F: Apparent Volume of Distribution\" in a section about scaling and platform. No mention of AD-specific usage. So invalid.\n\nNow confirm ADCS-ADL-Severe: The context includes \"ADCS-ADL-Severe: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living for Severe AD\" as a measure name. Also earlier \"ADCS-ADL\" is listed as a primary endpoint. So yes, it's a recognized measure. Acronym: ADCS-ADL. Might also be \"ADCS-ADL-Severe\" but that's the full name. The abbreviation used in documents: ADCS-ADL. We'll use that.\n\nReturn JSON array. Ensure proper formatting.",

The document seems to mention it but maybe as part of measuring something like plasma p-tau217? Actually the context shows \"Plasma p-tau217:3.04 pg/ml\" etc. The AUC extrapolation might refer to area under curve for some assay? But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents do not state that AUCextrap is a biomarker for Alzheimer's. It seems more like a pharmacokinetic parameter. There's no explicit statement that it's a marker. So likely invalid.\n\nSecond term: \"λz: Elimination Rate Constant\". The context also contains \"Context for λz: Elimination Rate Constant\" repeated. Again, appears in the same way. Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? No, elimination rate constant is a PK concept. Not a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nThus both are invalid. Acronym: For AUCextrap[%], the acronym is \"AUCextrap[%]\". But we need the most known/used abbreviation mentioned in the documents. The document uses \"AUCextrap[%]\" itself. So we could put that. But since it's invalid, we set acronym \"N/A\".

    "cot": "We need to parse the context. The user wants to validate two items: 'cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS)' and'sNAA: Systemic N-acetyl Aspartate (blood and urine)'. They want to know if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly rely on the provided documents. Let's examine the context.\n\nThere are multiple paragraphs referencing cNAA and sNAA. The context includes mention of cNAA: \"Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS)\" and references to measuring cNAA via MRS. It says \"cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS):...\". There's also mention of \"cNAA\" in the context: \"cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS): res the awardee to share...\" etc. But we need to see whether it's recognized as a marker for Alzheimer's. The text mentions \"cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS):...\". There is no explicit statement that cNAA is a recognized biomarker for Alzheimer's. The context seems to talk about measurement technology, but not necessarily that cNAA is a marker. However, earlier there might be mention of \"cNAA\" as a marker? Let's search.\n\nScrolling: The first paragraph: \"Context for cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS): res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". That doesn't say it's a marker. Then later: \"cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS): ng A positivity when both CSF and neuroimaging methods were used as standards.\" Wait, that line: \"ng A positivity when both CSF and neuroimaging methods were used as standards.\" Might refer to amyloid positivity? Not sure. The phrase \"ng A positivity\" maybe truncated. Hard to interpret.\n\nBut the context also includes \"cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS): ce not being affected by small variations introduced through pre-analytical, analytical, batch-to-batch, and lot-to-lot variability.\" So cNAA is measured by MRS. But is it considered a marker? The document may treat it as a biomarker. But we need to check if there's any mention that cNAA is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The context includes \"cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS):... Potential for a platform and the associated plasma test to be scaled up to accommodate high volume testing.\" Wait, that's about plasma test, but cNAA is cerebral. Maybe confusion.\n\nAlso, the context includes \"cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS):... Reflective of patient outcomes (assuming correct diagnosis of AD).\" That suggests cNAA is reflective of patient outcomes. So likely considered a marker.\n\nNow sNAA: \"Systemic N-acetyl Aspartate (blood and urine)\". The context includes \"sNAA: Systemic N-acetyl Aspartate (blood and urine): res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". Also \"sNAA: Systemic N-acetyl Aspartate (blood and urine): Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports 7 (2023) 355–380 DOI 10.3233/ADR-230029 IOS Press 355 Review Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease: A Review of Available Assays, Recent Developments, and Implications for Clinical Practice\". That article presumably discusses plasma biomarkers including sNAA? But the excerpt doesn't explicitly mention sNAA as a biomarker. It mentions \"plasma A-beta/42/40 ratio\", \"pTau-217\", etc. No direct mention of sNAA. The context also includes \"sNAA: Systemic N-acetyl Aspartate (blood and urine): son BC, Atri A, Clevenger C, et al. The Alzheimer’s Association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for specialty care.\" That again doesn't mention sNAA.\n\nThus, based solely on the provided context, we cannot confirm that sNAA is recognized as a marker. The only mention is that it's systemic N-acetyl Aspartate measured in blood and urine, but no evidence of correlation with AD. So likely invalid.\n\nHowever, we should double-check if any part of the context indicates sNAA is used as a biomarker. The context includes \"sNAA: Systemic N-acetyl Aspartate (blood and urine):... The Alzheimer’s Association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for specialty care.\" That guideline might include sNAA? But the excerpt doesn't mention it. So we can't assume.\n\nTherefore, for cNAA: Recognized marker? The context refers to cNAA as a marker? Let's find explicit statements. Search for \"cNAA\" in the context. The first lines: \"Context for cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS): res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellec- tual property...\". That's just context header. Later: \"cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS): ng A positivity when both CSF and neuroimaging methods were used as stan-dards.\" That seems incomplete. Could be \"cNAA positivity\"? Actually \"ng A positivity\" maybe \"Aβ positivity\"? Hard to parse. But then: \"cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS): ce not being aﬀected by small variations introduced through pre-analytical, analytical, batch-to-batch, and lot-to-lot variability.\" That describes stability. Then: \"cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS): Potential for a platform and the associated plasma test to be scaled up to accommodate high volume testing.\" That seems contradictory because cNAA is cerebral, not plasma. But maybe they mean plasma test for cNAA? Unclear.\n\nThen: \"cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS): *This is the experience and thoughts of our expert authors\". Then: \"cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS):... Reflective of patient outcomes (assuming correct diagnosis of AD)\".\n\nSo yes, cNAA appears to be considered a marker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention cNAA as a marker? The context states \"cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS):... Reflective of patient outcomes (assuming correct diagnosis of AD)\". That implies it's used as a marker. Also earlier: \"cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS):... Potential for a platform and the associated plasma test to be scaled up to accommodate high volume testing.\" That suggests it's a biomarker.\n\nThus, we can consider cNAA as a recognized marker. The acronym: \"cNAA\" itself. The most known abbreviation: \"cNAA\". The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For cNAA, the abbreviation is \"cNAA\". For sNAA, the abbreviation is \"sNAA\". But if sNAA is not recognized, we still output acronym \"N/A\" as per instruction. But we need to decide if sNAA is recognized. I think not.\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nFirst object:\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"cNAA: Cerebral N-acetyl Aspartate (measured by MRS)\",\n  \"valid\": true,\n  \"acronym\": \"cNAA\"\n}\n\nSecond object:\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"sNAA: Systemic N-acetyl Aspartate (blood and urine)\",\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n}\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate, probably array. The required response format: For each element, use JSON structure. Likely output array of objects. We'll do that.\n\nEnsure no extra keys. Use exactly fields: original_name, valid, acronym.\n\nLet's craft final answer.",

The context mentions \"Total Cholesterol\" but doesn't say it's a biomarker. It seems like a general lab measure. There's no mention of it being used as a biomarker for AD.

These recent results demonstrate the plasma p-tau assays’ ability...\" Wait that's about p-tau? But still referencing AKT. Also earlier: \"Context for AKT: Protein Kinase B (Akt) Activation: adigm for advancingfromdiscoverytoclinic.\" So there is some mention but unclear if it's validated as marker. The document references [82] which likely refers to a study about AKT? Let's check: The snippet shows \"[82]\" near the end of that paragraph: \"Context for AKT: Protein Kinase B (Akt) Activation: d a speciﬁcity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" That suggests a study showing diagnostic performance. So yes, AKT is considered a marker.\n\nNow mTOR: There's mention: \"Context for mTOR: Mammalian Target Of Rapamycin Activation: Citation: Gunes, S.; Aizawa, Y.; Sugashi, T.; Sugimoto, M.; Rodrigues, P.P. Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in the Current State: A Narrative Review.\" That seems like a review article discussing biomarkers including mTOR. But we need to see if mTOR is recognized as a marker. The context includes \"Context for mTOR: Mammalian Target Of Rapamycin Activation:\" but no explicit statement that mTOR is a marker. However, the review might discuss it. But we only have the excerpt. It doesn't explicitly say mTOR is used as a biomarker. The question: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to decide validity.

So output: {\"original_name\":\"AKT: Protein Kinase B (Akt) Activation\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"AKT\"}.\n\nFor mTOR: Is it recognized? The context mentions \"Context for mTOR: Mammalian Target Of Rapamycin Activation: Citation: Gunes...\". That indicates mTOR is discussed as a biomarker. But is it recognized? The text says \"Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in the Current State: A Narrative Review\". It likely covers mTOR among others. But we don't have direct evidence that mTOR is a marker. The instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" Since mTOR is mentioned but not necessarily proven as a marker. The phrase \"Mammalian Target Of Rapamycin Activation\" could be a pathway, not a biomarker. The context doesn't provide evidence of diagnostic performance. So maybe invalid.\n\nBut let's examine again: The context for mTOR includes \"Context for mTOR: Mammalian Target Of Rapamycin Activation: Citation: Gunes, S.; Aizawa, Y.; Sugashi, T.; Sugimoto, M.; Rodrigues, P.P. Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in the Current State: A Narrative Review.\" That review presumably lists biomarkers. But we can't assume mTOR is listed.

    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want us to analyze two items: 'RMR: Resting Metabolic Rate' and 'RBANS: Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neurological Status'. Based strictly on the provided documents, we need to decide if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's disease. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must produce JSON objects per element. For each element, include original_name, valid boolean, acronym string. If not valid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nWe must rely solely on the provided context. Let's examine the context for mentions of RMR and RBANS.\n\nIn the context, there are multiple references to RMR: \"Context for RMR: Resting Metabolic Rate:...\". It appears in several paragraphs. But is RMR considered a biomarker? The text says: \"Resting Metabolic Rate: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". That seems like a placeholder or formatting artifact. There's no mention that RMR is a recognized biomarker for Alzheimer's. It's just part of the document's header. There is no evidence that RMR is used as a biomarker. So likely it's not validated.\n\nBut let's check if there's any mention of RMR being used as a biomarker. Search: \"RMR\" appears only in those contexts. No mention of metabolic rate as a biomarker. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nNow RBANS: The context includes repeated sections describing RBANS. It states: \"The RBANS is for use in both clinical practice and research settings.\" \"Diagnostic accuracy for both clinical AD and MCI due to AD have been demonstrated.\" So yes, RBANS is a neuropsychological battery used as a marker for Alzheimer's disease. The acronym is RBANS. The full name is given: Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neurological Status. So valid = true, acronym = RBANS.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"RMR: Resting Metabolic Rate\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"RBANS: Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neurological Status\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"RBANS\"}\n]\n\nMake sure JSON array or separate objects? System instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" then shows object. Probably return array of objects. We'll do array.\n\nAlso ensure no extra keys. Use exactly fields: original_name, valid, acronym.\n\nLet's craft final answer.",
    "response": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"RMR: Resting Metabolic Rate\",\n    \"valid\": false,\n    \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"RBANS: Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neurological Status\",\n    \"valid\": true,\n    \"acronym\": \"RBANS\"\n  }\n]\n```"

    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want us to analyze the list ['PPD: Periodontal Pocket Depth', 'MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging'] based strictly on the provided documents. For each element, we need to output JSON object with original_name, valid boolean, and acronym string. We should check whether each is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must rely solely on the provided context. Let's examine the context for mentions of these items.\n\nFirst, \"PPD: Periodontal Pocket Depth\" appears multiple times in the context. It seems to be used as a measure? The context says: \"Context for PPD: Periodontal Pocket Depth: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". There's mention of technology for measurement of pTau-217. But that's about pTau-217, not PPD. However, earlier lines: \"Periodontal Pocket Depth: res the awardee to share...\" maybe truncated. There might be some confusion. But we need to see if PPD is considered a recognized marker for Alzheimer's in the documents. The context includes references to periodontal pocket depth but no explicit statement that it's a biomarker for Alzheimer's. It's just a term used in the document. So likely not validated as a marker.\n\nSecond, \"MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging\" appears many times. The context discusses MRI as a structural imaging biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, predicting disease progression. It also mentions MRI's sensitivity and specificity for prediction of conversion from MCI to AD. So MRI is indeed a recognized imaging biomarker for Alzheimer's per the documents. The acronym used is \"MRI\".\n\nBut we need to confirm if there is an abbreviation used in the documents. The text uses \"MRI\" consistently. So the acronym is \"MRI\".\n\nNow we need to produce JSON objects:\n\nFor PPD: Periodontal Pocket Depth -> valid: false, acronym: \"N/A\"\n\nFor MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging -> valid: true, acronym: \"MRI\"\n\nBut we must ensure that the acronym is the most known/used abbreviation mentioned in the documents. That would be \"MRI\".\n\nAlso we need to follow the required response format: For each element, use JSON structure. Possibly produce array of objects? The instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" then shows example. It doesn't specify array but likely we should output separate JSON objects one after another? Usually they'd expect an array. But they didn't explicitly say array. They said \"For each element, use this JSON structure\". Could output each JSON object separated by newline. But safer to output an array of objects. But the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {... }\". So maybe they want each object individually. But typical tasks ask to output a JSON array. I'll output an array containing two objects.\n\nLet's double-check the context for PPD. Search for \"PPD\" occurrences. The context has \"Context for PPD: Periodontal Pocket Depth: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellec-tual property...\". That line seems incomplete. It may refer to \"PPD\" as a variable or something else. But there's no mention that PPD is a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nCheck for \"pTau-217\" measurement technology. That's a biomarker. But not relevant.\n\nThus final answer: array of two JSON objects.\n\nMake sure to keep keys exactly: \"original_name\", \"valid\", \"acronym\".\n\nReturn as JSON. Ensure proper formatting.",

Also mentions \"plasma Aβ42/40 ratio\" etc. But specifically anti-Pg IgG is referenced. So valid.\n\nWhat about NPI? The Neuropsychiatric Inventory is a behavioral assessment tool, not a biomarker but a clinical measure. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The context lists NPI as a measure type, but is it a biomarker? It's a neuropsychiatric inventory used as an endpoint. The instruction: \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's.\" NPI is not a biomarker; it's a clinical rating scale. The context refers to NPI as a measure, but not as a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\" in Table 1. It lists type of COAa, disease severity, frequency. It seems like a measure used in clinical trials. But the question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" The document doesn't say it's a biomarker; it's a clinical assessment. So I'd mark invalid.\n\nNow acronyms: For anti-Pg IgG, the acronym is \"IgG\"? Actually the marker's name is \"Anti-Pg IgG: Anti-P. gingivalis Immunoglobulin G\". The acronym could be \"anti-Pg IgG\" or \"IgG\". The context uses \"anti-Pg IgG\" as the term. So we should provide \"anti-Pg IgG\".\n\nFor NPI, acronym is \"NPI\". So we give \"NPI\".\n\nThus output JSON array with objects.\n\nLet's produce:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"anti-Pg IgG: Anti-P. gingivalis Immunoglobulin G\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"anti-Pg IgG\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines maybe.

The context includes mention of \"Anti-drug Antibodies\" in the first paragraph: \"Context for ADA: Anti-drug Antibodies: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" It says \"Anti-drug Antibodies: riers are at greater risk...\" That seems to refer to anti-drug antibodies as a biomarker? But is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The text says \"Anti-drug Antibodies: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That suggests it's a biomarker for safety, but not necessarily a marker for Alzheimer's disease itself. It's about risk of ARIA. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The document mentions anti-drug antibodies as a biomarker for safety in anti-Aβ therapies. But is it considered a marker for Alzheimer's? It might be a biomarker for therapeutic response or safety, but not a direct disease biomarker. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The context indicates that anti-drug antibodies are associated with ARIA risk in anti-Aβ therapies, which are treatments for Alzheimer's. But they are not a marker of disease progression or diagnosis. The question: Are they recognized as a marker for Alzheimer's? Possibly not. The context doesn't say they are a marker for Alzheimer's disease itself. They are a biomarker for safety in therapy. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. I'd lean to \"invalid\" because it's not a disease biomarker. But let's examine further: The context says \"Anti-drug Antibodies: riers are at greater risk of developing ARIA when treated with anti-Aβ therapies.\" That implies that measuring anti-drug antibodies could predict ARIA risk. But ARIA is a side effect. So it's a safety biomarker, not a disease biomarker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention anti-drug antibodies as a biomarker for safety in anti-Aβ therapies. But the question might consider that as a marker for Alzheimer's? The phrase \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" could include biomarkers used in Alzheimer's research/trials, even if they are safety biomarkers. But the instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" Anti-drug antibodies are correlated with ARIA risk in anti-Aβ therapies, which are used for Alzheimer's. But the correlation is with ARIA, not directly with Alzheimer's disease. So maybe it's not a marker for Alzheimer's disease itself. I'd mark it as invalid.\n\nSecond item: \"RO7105705: Serum concentration of RO7105705\". The context includes mention of \"Serum concentration of RO7105705\" and references to a technology for measuring pTau-217 licensed to C2N Diagnostics. There's mention of \"pTau-217\" as a biomarker. But the item is \"RO7105705: Serum concentration of RO7105705\". Is that a marker? The context says \"Serum concentration of RO7105705: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". It refers to a technology for measuring pTau-217. But the item \"RO7105705: Serum concentration of RO7105705\" appears to be a product name? Actually, \"RO7105705\" might be a compound or drug candidate. The context says \"Serum concentration of RO7105705: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellectual property...\". It also says \"The technology for the measurement of pTau-217\". So perhaps RO7105705 is a drug candidate whose serum concentration is being measured. But is it a marker? The context does not explicitly say that measuring serum concentration of RO7105705 is a biomarker for Alzheimer's. It just says it's part of a research award. There's no mention that RO7105705 is a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut we need to check if there is any mention of \"RO7105705\" as a marker. The context: \"Context for RO7105705: Serum concentration of RO7105705: res the awardee to share with the Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellec-tual property...\". Then later: \"The Alzheimer’s Association revenue derived from the licensing of intellec-tual property...\". Then: \"The technology for the measurement of pTau-217\". So the context is about a technology for measuring pTau-217, not about RO7105705. So it's not a marker.\n\nThus both items are invalid.\n\nBut we need to produce JSON objects for each element. Format:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"...\",\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n}\n\nSo for each of the two items.\n\nDouble-check: The first item \"ADA: Anti-drug Antibodies\". The acronym would be \"ADA\"? But the context uses \"ADA: Anti-drug Antibodies\". But the acronym \"ADA\" stands for \"Anti-drug Antibodies\"? Usually \"ADA\" stands for \"anti-drug antibody\". But the context uses \"ADA: Anti-drug Antibodies\". So the acronym is \"ADA\". But since it's invalid, we put \"N/A\".\n\nSecond item \"RO7105705: Serum concentration of RO7105705\".

They want to validate whether IL-4 and IL-5 are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide acronym.\n\nWe need to check if the documents mention IL-4 or IL-5 as markers. The context includes \"Context for IL-4: Interleukin 4\" and some citations referencing IL-4. It says \"Interleukin 4: Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports 7 (2023) 355–380 DOI 10.3233/ADR-230029 IOS Press 355 Review Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease...\" So IL-4 appears in the title? Actually the context shows \"Context for IL-4: Interleukin 4: Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports 7 (2023) 355–380\". That seems like a reference to a paper titled \"Interleukin 4\" maybe. But we need to see if IL-4 is recognized as a marker. There's also mention: \"d a specificity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].

However, the context may include a sentence: \"The NfL is a component of the neural cytoskeleton released after axonal damage.\" Not relevant.\n\nBut the context for IL-5 similarly includes \"Context for IL-5: Interleukin 5: Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports 7 (2023) 355–380\". So both IL-4 and IL-5 appear as titles of papers. Are they considered markers? The question: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to decide validity based on evidence.

The instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So we need to evaluate if there's sufficient evidence.\n\nLet's examine the context for IL-4 again: The first part: \"Context for IL-4: Interleukin 4: Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports 7 (2023) 355–380 DOI 10.3233/ADR-230029 IOS Press 355 Review Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease: A Review of Available Assays, Recent Developments, and Implications for Clinical Practice Marcos V. Paisa,b,∗, Orestes V. Forlenzab and Breno S. Diniza... Received 3 April 2023 Accepted 3 April 2023 Pre-press 25 April 2023 Published 3 May 2023 Abstract. Recently, low-sensitive plasma assays have been replaced by new ultra-sensitive assays such as single molecule enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Simoa), the Mesoscale Discovery (MSD) platform, and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) with higher accuracy in the determination of plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite the significant variability, many studies have established in-house cut-off values for the most promising available biomarkers. We first reviewed the most used laboratory methods and assays to measure plasma AD biomarkers. Next, we review studies focused on the diagnostic performance of these biomarkers to identify AD cases, predict cognitive decline in pre-clinical AD cases, and differentiate AD cases from other dementia. We summarized data from studies published until January 2023. A combination of plasma A‑42/40...\"\n\nSo the paper is about plasma biomarkers, but not specifically IL-4. The title \"Interleukin 4\" might be a separate article? Actually the context might be incorrectly formatted. But likely the paper is about IL-4 as a biomarker. But we don't have explicit statements.\n\nAlso later: \"Context for IL-4: Interleukin 4: d a specificity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82]. These recent results demonstrate the plasma p‑tau assays’ ability to accurately diagnose AD (based on clinical and pathological criteria), to identify individuals at the earliest stages of the AD pathological continuum, and to identify older adults at the highest risk of cognitive decline.\" That paragraph refers to plasma p-tau assays, not IL-4. So IL-4 not referenced.\n\nThus insufficient evidence that IL-4 is a recognized marker per documents. Similarly IL-5.\n\nTherefore both would be marked invalid.\n\nBut we need to provide acronym.

They want to validate whether IL-4 and IL-5 are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide acronym.\n\nWe need to check if the documents mention IL-4 or IL-5 as markers. The context includes \"Context for IL-4: Interleukin 4\" and some citations referencing IL-4. It says \"Interleukin 4: Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports 7 (2023) 355–380 DOI 10.3233/ADR-230029 IOS Press 355 Review Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease...\" So IL-4 appears in the title? Actually the context shows \"Context for IL-4: Interleukin 4: Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports 7 (2023) 355–380\". That seems like a reference to a paper titled \"Interleukin 4\" maybe. But we need to see if IL-4 is recognized as a marker. There's also mention: \"d a specificity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82]. These recent results demonstrate the plasma p-tau assays’ ability to accurately diagnose AD...\". Wait that's about p-tau, not IL-4. But earlier there might be mention of IL-4's diagnostic performance. Let's search within context: \"IL-4\" appears only in the heading. There is no explicit statement that IL-4 is a marker. However, the context may include a sentence: \"The NfL is a component of the neural cytoskeleton released after axonal damage.\" Not relevant.\n\nBut the context for IL-5 similarly includes \"Context for IL-5: Interleukin 5: Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports 7 (2023) 355–380\". So both IL-4 and IL-5 appear as titles of papers. Are they considered markers? The question: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nThus we need to decide validity based on evidence. Does the document mention IL-4 as a marker? The context includes \"Context for IL-4: Interleukin 4: Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports 7 (2023) 355–380 DOI 10.3233/ADR-230029 IOS Press 355 Review Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease: A Review of Available Assays, Recent Developments, and Implications for Clinical Practice Marcos V. Paisa,...\"\n\nIt doesn't explicitly say IL-4 is a marker. But the title of the paper could be \"Interleukin 4\" which suggests it's about IL-4. But is IL-4 recognized as a marker? The context also mentions \"d a specificity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82].\" That might refer to IL-4? Hard to tell. Could be referring to IL-4's diagnostic performance. But the text snippet is ambiguous.\n\nSimilarly for IL-5: same pattern.\n\nGiven limited info, we should treat them as potentially markers but uncertain. The instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So we need to evaluate if there's sufficient evidence.\n\nLet's examine the context for IL-4 again: The first part: \"Context for IL-4: Interleukin 4: Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports 7 (2023) 355–380 DOI 10.3233/ADR-230029 IOS Press 355 Review Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease: A Review of Available Assays, Recent Developments, and Implications for Clinical Practice Marcos V. Paisa,b,∗, Orestes V. Forlenzab and Breno S. Diniza... Received 3 April 2023 Accepted 3 April 2023 Pre-press 25 April 2023 Published 3 May 2023 Abstract. Recently, low-sensitive plasma assays have been replaced by new ultra-sensitive assays such as single molecule enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Simoa), the Mesoscale Discovery (MSD) platform, and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) with higher accuracy in the determination of plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite the significant variability, many studies have established in-house cut-off values for the most promising available biomarkers. We first reviewed the most used laboratory methods and assays to measure plasma AD biomarkers. Next, we review studies focused on the diagnostic performance of these biomarkers to identify AD cases, predict cognitive decline in pre-clinical AD cases, and differentiate AD cases from other dementia. We summarized data from studies published until January 2023. A combination of plasma A‑42/40...\"\n\nSo the paper is about plasma biomarkers, but not specifically IL-4. The title \"Interleukin 4\" might be a separate article? Actually the context might be incorrectly formatted. But likely the paper is about IL-4 as a biomarker. But we don't have explicit statements.\n\nAlso later: \"Context for IL-4: Interleukin 4: d a specificity of 93.3%, with an AUC of 0.94 to diagnose patients with AD [82]. These recent results demonstrate the plasma p‑tau assays’ ability to accurately diagnose AD (based on clinical and pathological criteria), to identify individuals at the earliest stages of the AD pathological continuum, and to identify older adults at the highest risk of cognitive decline.\" That paragraph refers to plasma p-tau assays, not IL-4. So IL-4 not referenced.\n\nThus insufficient evidence that IL-4 is a recognized marker per documents. Similarly IL-5.\n\nTherefore both would be marked invalid.\n\nBut we need to provide acronym. The acronym for IL-4 is \"IL-4\" itself. For IL-5 is \"IL-5\".\n\nHowever, if invalid, acronym set to \"N/A\".\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"IL-4: Interleukin 4\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"IL-5: Interleukin 5\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separated by comma inside array.

They want to validate each element in the list ['NF-L: Neurofilament Light', 'AMMONIA: Ammonia level'].\n\nWe must check if each is recognized marker for Alzheimer's per documents. For NF-L: There are many references indicating NF-L is a marker of neuroaxonal injury and neurodegeneration, used in AD. So it's valid. Acronym: NF-L stands for Neurofilament Light. But they might want the abbreviation used: NF-L. The document uses \"Neurofilament Light\" and \"NfL\". The acronym likely \"NfL\". The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" The documents mention \"NF-L\" and \"NfL\". Which one is most used? Many references show \"NfL\" (lowercase f). But the first line says \"NF-L: Neurofilament Light\". So maybe \"NF-L\". We'll choose \"NfL\" because that's common. But we should pick what appears in documents. Let's scan: The context includes \"Neurofilament Light:...\", \"NfL\" appears in some citations: \"association of plasma neurofilament light\". Also \"serum neurofilament light\". The acronym \"NfL\" appears. So we can say acronym: \"NfL\".\n\nNow for AMMONIA: The context mentions ammonia level but no evidence linking ammonia to AD. It just describes general info about ammonia levels in AD? Actually the context says \"Ammonia level: ns and delusions start...\" It's unclear. There's no mention of ammonia being a biomarker for AD. The context seems to talk about ammonia level but not as a marker. So we consider it invalid. Acronym: \"N/A\".\n\nThus produce JSON array? The required format: For each element, use JSON structure.

In the document, FAQ appears as a measure used in trials, but it's not described as a biomarker. So likely not considered a recognized marker. But the instruction: \"validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" For each element, determine if it is actually a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's. So FAQ is not a biomarker; it's a functional assessment tool. So valid=false.\n\nSecond: 18F-GTP1 PET: fluorine-18 labeled Genentech Tau Probe positron emission tomography imaging. This is definitely a biomarker: tau PET imaging. The documents include references to [18F]GTP1 as a radioligand for detecting neurofibrillary tangle tau pathology. So yes, recognized marker.

The context might include albumin as a biomarker but maybe not validated. Let's search within the context: \"albumin\" appears in \"Serum albumin:\" lines. But is there evidence that albumin is used as a biomarker? The context says \"Serum albumin: / Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease\" but that's ambiguous. Might be a heading. The context also includes \"Serum albumin: adigm for advanc-ingfromdiscoverytoclinic.\" It's unclear.\n\nGiven the instruction: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So we need to decide if albumin is considered a recognized marker. The context includes references to albumin but not clear evidence. The references show albumin being measured? Actually, the context includes \"Serum albumin: / Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease\" but that could be a heading for a section about albumin. But we don't see specific statements linking albumin to Alzheimer's pathology. The references include \"Serum albumin: / Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease\" but maybe it's just a placeholder. The context also includes \"Serum albumin: adigm for advanc-ingfromdiscoverytoclinic.\" That suggests albumin is being considered as a biomarker. But is there evidence? The references include \"Serum albumin: / Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease\" and \"Serum albumin: adigm for advanc-ingfromdiscoverytoclinic.\" Those seem to be headings for sections. But we cannot assume it's a recognized marker unless there's explicit mention. The context also includes \"Serum albumin: / Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease\" but no details. The references after that include various studies about plasma amyloid, etc., not albumin.\n\nThus likely albumin is not validated as a marker in the provided documents. So we should set valid=false, acronym=\"N/A\".\n\nBut let's double-check: Are there any references that specifically mention albumin as a biomarker? The context includes \"Serum albumin: / Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease\" but then goes into references about amyloid, etc. No direct mention of albumin's correlation. So I'd mark invalid.\n\nTherefore output JSON array with two objects.\n\nLet's produce:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"HMGB1: High Mobility Group Box 1\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"HMGB1\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"Albumin: Serum albumin\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nMake sure formatting exactly as required.",

    },
    "cot": "We need to parse the context. The user wants to analyze two items: 'τ-SUVR: Tau Standard Uptake Value Ratio' and 'WM-COMP: Working Memory Composite Z-score'. They want to see if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents, and provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly rely on the provided documents. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, there is mention of τ-SUVR: Tau Standard Uptake Value Ratio. In multiple places: \"Context for τ-SUVR: Tau Standard Uptake Value Ratio: pg/ml\" etc. It appears in the document as a term. It's used as a biomarker? There is mention of \"Tau Standard Uptake Value Ratio\" but it's unclear if it's considered a marker. The context says \"Tau Standard Uptake Value Ratio: ce not being affected...\" etc. But we need to check if it's recognized as a marker for Alzheimer's. The text mentions \"Tau Standard Uptake Value Ratio\" as part of imaging metrics like tau-PET SUVr. For example: \"CSF tau levels and tau-PET SUVr\". So tau-PET SUVr is a measurement. The abbreviation \"τ-SUVR\" might refer to tau Standard Uptake Value Ratio. Is it recognized as a marker? The context indicates that tau-PET SUVr is used as a reference standard for tau pathology. So yes, tau-PET SUVr is a biomarker. The question: \"Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents?\" Yes, tau-PET SUVr is used as a biomarker. The acronym: \"τ-SUVR\" itself. But maybe the more common abbreviation is \"tau-PET SUVr\" or \"τ-PET SUVR\"? The document uses \"τ-SUVR\" as the term. So we can say acronym: \"τ-SUVR\".\n\nSecond, WM-COMP: Working Memory Composite Z-score. The context shows many tables about WM-COMP. It seems to be a composite z-score used as a cognitive test battery. Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context lists it under \"Measure name\" type of COAa. It appears as a measure used in clinical trials. But is it a biomarker? It's a cognitive composite, not a biological marker. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents show WM-COMP as a measure used in clinical trials, but not necessarily a biomarker. The instruction: \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". The context says \"fluid-based and imaging biomarkers\" earlier. Then later \"WM-COMP: Working Memory Composite Z-score\" appears in tables of measures. It might be considered a clinical outcome measure rather than a biomarker. The user asks: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" Since WM-COMP is listed as a measure, but not explicitly called a biomarker. The question: Should we consider it invalid because it's not a biomarker? The instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate... valid: false, acronym: N/A\". So we need to decide if WM-COMP qualifies as a marker. The context: \"Working Memory Composite Z-score\" appears in tables of measures. It is likely a cognitive composite used as an outcome measure, not a biomarker. The user asked to validate markers. The context says \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in...\" then lists WM-COMP. But the table includes various measures including WM-COMP. The question: Are these considered markers? The definition: \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". The WM-COMP is a cognitive test composite, not a fluid or imaging biomarker. So I'd mark it as invalid.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"τ-SUVR: Tau Standard Uptake Value Ratio\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"τ-SUVR\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"WM-COMP: Working Memory Composite Z-score\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nBut ensure JSON array?

The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nWe need to decide if RC: Reasoning Composite Z-score is a recognized marker. The context shows it's referenced but maybe not defined as a biomarker. But the table might include it as a measure type? Let's examine the table snippet: I saw entries like \"Digit Symbol; Digit Span Forward/Backward; Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Digit ordering (span), Digit Span PerfO 4 4 4 Progression from MCI to AD...\"\n\nBut I didn't see RC or SP explicitly in the table. However, earlier there is \"Context for RC: Reasoning Composite Z-score: to-decision procedures.\" That suggests RC is a composite score used perhaps as a measure. But is it a biomarker? It's a composite z-score of reasoning tasks, likely a neuropsychological test composite. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents talk about biomarkers like amyloid beta, tau, etc. But also mention neuropsychological tests as outcomes. But are they considered biomarkers? Usually biomarkers are biological measures, not cognitive composites. But the context may treat them as \"measure\" types. The table lists \"Measure name\" and \"Type of COAa\" (maybe category). For example, \"Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)\" has type PerfO. So RC: Reasoning Composite Z-score could be a measure type. But we need to find if it's present in the table. Let's search mentally: I don't recall seeing RC or SP in the table excerpt. There is \"Speed of Processing Composite Z-score\" maybe not shown. But the context lines show \"Context for SP: Speed of Processing Composite Z-score:...\" So it's referenced.\n\nGiven limited context, we can say that RC and SP are mentioned but not necessarily validated as biomarkers. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents mention them as composite scores used in assessments, but not necessarily as biomarkers. However, the table includes many neuropsychological tests, which are used as outcome measures, not biomarkers. The question might consider them as markers because they are used to assess cognition. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". The context includes references to \"Biomarker\" in general, but the specific items RC and SP are composite z-scores of reasoning and speed of processing. Are they considered biomarkers? Possibly yes, as they are composite scores used to detect cognitive decline. But the context doesn't explicitly state they are biomarkers. The table lists them under \"Measure name\" maybe. But we can't confirm.\n\nLet's read the table snippet more thoroughly. The table shows columns: Measure name, Type of COAa, Disease severity, Total frequency, Preclinical AD, MCIb, Mild AD, Moderate AD, Severe AD, Other severity/Type not listed. Under \"Measure name\" there are entries like \"Digit Symbol; Digit Span Forward/Backward; Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Digit ordering (span), Digit Span PerfO 4 4 4 Progression from MCI to AD (severity not specified) 4 FCSRT (Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test) PerfO 4 4 4 4 Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) PerfO 4 4 4 4 Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) PerfO 4 4 4\".\n\nIt seems the table is truncated. Not sure if RC or SP appear.\n\nHowever, the context lines \"Context for RC: Reasoning Composite Z-score: to-decision procedures.\" Might refer to a section header describing how RC is used. But no explicit mention of RC being a biomarker.\n\nThus, based on strict reading, we cannot confirm RC or SP as recognized markers. They are just composite scores used in assessment. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" I'd lean towards false, because the documents do not label them as biomarkers. They are composite z-scores used as measures, but not necessarily biomarkers. The user wants us to output JSON objects for each element. For each, we need original_name, valid boolean, acronym.\n\nOriginal names: 'RC: Reasoning Composite Z-score' and 'SP: Speed of Processing Composite Z-score'.\n\nNow, what is the acronym? The acronym is already given: RC and SP. But the instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For RC: Reasoning Composite Z-score, the acronym is RC. For SP: Speed of Processing Composite Z-score, acronym is SP. But maybe the full abbreviation is \"RC\" and \"SP\". So we will output those.\n\nThus, for each, valid = false, acronym = \"N/A\"? Wait, if not valid, we should still provide acronym? The spec says: If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: {\"original_name\":\"name\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}.\n\nYes, so we set acronym to \"N/A\".\n\nTherefore both are invalid markers per documents. Output two JSON objects.\n\nBut we need to produce a JSON array? The specification says \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" So we can output an array of objects. Or separate objects? Probably array.\n\nWe'll output:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"RC: Reasoning Composite Z-score\",\n    \"valid\": false,\n    \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"original_name\": \"SP: Speed of Processing Composite Z-score\",\n    \"valid\": false,\n    \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separated by comma inside array.

The documents mention EM-COMP: Episodic Memory Composite Z-score appears in the tables. It seems like a measurement used in the study. But is it a recognized biomarker? It's a composite score derived from episodic memory tests. The document says it's a measure name. It might be considered a cognitive test battery, not a biomarker per se. Biomarkers usually refer to biological measures like Aβ, tau, etc. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" - could include cognitive assessments? The context includes many cognitive tests. They are used as COAs (clinical outcome assessments). Are they considered markers?

And again: \"Context for RSS: Resting-State System Segregation Metric: ists of methodological requirements and did not involve human nor animal participants.\" So there is some mention but no explicit statement that it's a biomarker for AD. But maybe it's used as a metric? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\" - we need to see if the document states that RSS is a marker.

There are many references about digital biomarkers, wearable accelerometers, etc. The context includes \"ActiGraph: wearable accelerometer measuring physical activity and sedentary time: cognitive tests take a long time...\" and references to digital biomarkers. However, is ActiGraph itself considered a marker? It's a device measuring physical activity, which could serve as a digital biomarker. The documents mention \"wearable accelerometer measuring physical activity and sedentary time\" as part of digital biomarkers. But do they say it's a recognized marker? They talk about digital biomarkers for AD. The device is used to capture data. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention \"digital biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders\" and \"wearable accelerometer measuring physical activity and sedentary time\" as part of digital biomarkers. That suggests it's a marker. But is it explicitly validated? The context says \"ActiGraph: wearable accelerometer measuring physical activity and sedentary time:... digital biomarkers may have the potential to accelerate AD diagnosis...\".

Are they considered recognized markers? The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents refer to T2 weighted MRI and SWI MRI as imaging techniques used to detect structural imaging biomarkers. But do they themselves serve as markers? Usually, imaging modalities produce biomarkers like hippocampal volume, cortical thickness etc. The document says \"Structural imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease: predicting disease progression.\" That suggests that T2 MRI is used to measure structural imaging biomarkers. But is T2 MRI itself a marker? It's more a modality. The question might interpret \"marker\" as a measurable indicator. The context indicates that T2 weighted MRI is used to measure pTau-217 technology?

There's no explicit statement that T2 MRI is a marker. It just mentions it's a type of MRI. Similarly for SWI MRI. So likely they are not recognized markers per se. But maybe the context includes \"Structural imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease: predicting disease progression.\" That could imply that T2 MRI can capture structural biomarkers. But still, the term \"T2 MRI\" is not a biomarker; it's a technique. The question may expect that they are not recognized markers.

Use strictly the info in the context. Provide JSON per element.\n\nWe need to check if the items appear as markers in the documents. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst item: \"SUVr: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\". The context includes several mentions of SUVr. For example: \"Standardized Uptake Value Ratio: ce not being affected...\" etc. Also \"Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\" appears. It says \"Standardized Uptake Value Ratio: ce not being aﬀected by small variations...\". Also \"Standardized Uptake Value Ratio: the AD pathological continuum...\". So it's used as a metric for PET imaging. It's definitely a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context indicates that SUVr is used as a measure of amyloid PET uptake, used as a reference standard for Aβ confirmation. So yes, it's a recognized marker. The acronym is SUVr. But the question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For SUVr, the abbreviation is SUVr itself. So we output:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"SUVr: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio\",\n  \"valid\": true,\n  \"acronym\": \"SUVr\"\n}\n\nSecond item: \"BBB opening volume: Blood-brain barrier opening volume measured in cubic millimeters\".\n\nIn the context, there's mention of \"Blood-brain barrier opening volume measured in cubic millimeters\" as part of a heading maybe. There's mention of \"BBB opening volume\" but is it considered a marker? The context refers to \"BBB opening volume measured in cubic millimeters\" as a parameter. But is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The context seems to discuss it as a measurement related to treatments, but not necessarily a biomarker for diagnosing AD. The context states: \"BBB opening volume measured in cubic millimeters:...\". But does the document say it's a marker? It might be a measurement used in some therapeutic context. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The context doesn't explicitly say it's a biomarker for AD. It just describes it as a measurement. There is no mention that it's used as a biomarker for AD. So likely invalid. The acronym would be \"BBB opening volume\" or \"BBB opening volume\"? But since it's invalid, we set acronym to \"N/A\".\n\nThus second entry:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"BBB opening volume: Blood-brain barrier opening volume measured in cubic millimeters\",\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n}\n\nBut let's double-check if the context uses \"BBB opening volume\" as a marker. Search context: \"BBB opening volume measured in cubic millimeters\" appears near the end. It says \"BBB opening volume measured in cubic millimeters:...\". But earlier, there is mention of \"BBB opening volume\" as a measurement. But is it used as a biomarker? The context says \"Blood-brain barrier opening volume measured in cubic millimeters:...\". It might be used as a measurement for drug delivery or something. Not necessarily a biomarker for AD. The user specifically asks: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context does not support that. So invalid.\n\nAlso the acronym: The document uses \"BBB opening volume\" as phrase. But the acronym might be \"BBB opening volume\" or \"BBB opening volume\" is not an acronym. The abbreviation \"BBM\" stands for blood-based biomarker. But that's not the same. So we set \"N/A\".\n\nThus produce JSON array? The instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" They didn't specify array vs separate objects. Probably produce an array of objects. But the system instructions: \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {... }\". So we should output a JSON array of those objects. Or maybe just output each object separated by newline? Usually they'd expect an array. I'll output an array.\n\nThus final answer: JSON array with two objects.\n\nLet's craft final.",

The context says \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Haemosiderin Deposition: ful accuracy.\" It seems they are describing ARIA-H as a type of imaging abnormality.

They are imaging abnormalities. They could be considered markers of treatment-related changes, not necessarily disease markers. So maybe they are not recognized markers for AD. But the user wants us to decide based on the documents. The documents mention ARIA-H and ARIA-E as part of the context. There's no explicit statement that they are recognized markers for AD.

But likely ARIA-H and ARIA-E are considered imaging abnormalities that can occur during anti-amyloid therapies. They may not be direct markers of AD pathology but rather side effects. However, the question asks whether they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention them but do not explicitly state they are markers for AD. They are imaging abnormalities. They could be considered markers of treatment-related changes, not necessarily disease markers. So maybe they are not recognized markers for AD. But the user wants us to decide based on the documents. The documents mention ARIA-H and ARIA-E as part of the context. There's no explicit statement that they are recognized markers for AD. They are just imaging abnormalities. So I'd say they are not recognized markers for AD. But we need to check if there is any mention that they are used as biomarkers. The context: \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Haemosiderin Deposition: ful accuracy.\" Might be incomplete. But earlier: \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Haemosiderin Deposition: hon L,\" etc. It's unclear. But I think they are not recognized markers for AD. So set valid: false. Acronym: \"ARIA-H\" or \"ARIA-E\"? The abbreviation is ARIA-H and ARIA-E. The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For each item, we should give the acronym. For ARIA-H: the acronym is ARIA-H. For ARIA-E: ARIA-E. But if it's invalid, we set acronym \"N/A\".\n\nBut the instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\"\n\nThus for both items, we will output valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\".\n\nHowever, we need to double-check if the documents mention ARIA-H and ARIA-E as markers. The context includes \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormality Haemosiderin Deposition: ful accuracy.\" That phrase might be truncated but suggests some accuracy measure. But it's about imaging abnormality detection. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents talk about ARIA-H and ARIA-E as imaging abnormalities that can be detected via imaging modalities. They are not typical biomarkers for AD diagnosis. They are complications of anti-amyloid therapy. So I'd consider them not recognized markers for AD. So valid=false.\n\nThus produce JSON array with two objects.\n\nLet's craft final answer accordingly.",

We have two items: 'Flortaucipir PET: Flortaucipir F18 PET scan measuring tau deposition' and 'CDR-SB: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale – Sum of Boxes'.\n\nWe need to check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to documents. The context includes mention of Flortaucipir PET as a biomarker measuring tau deposition. It says \"Flortaucipir F18 PET scan measuring tau deposition\" and lists it among imaging biomarkers. So yes it's a recognized marker. Acronym? In the document, it's called \"Flortaucipir PET\". But maybe abbreviation is \"Flortaucipir PET\" itself. They might refer to \"Flortaucipir PET\" as a marker. The acronym could be \"Flortaucipir PET\" but that's not an acronym. Maybe \"Flortaucipir PET\" is the term. However the instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation for that marker/biomarker.\" For Flortaucipir PET, the abbreviation could be \"Flortaucipir PET\" or \"Flortaucipir F18 PET\". There's no shorter acronym like \"FTP\"? Not given. So we may set acronym as \"Flortaucipir PET\".\n\nNow CDR-SB: It's a clinical rating scale, not a biomarker per se. The context says \"Clinical Dementia Rating Scale – Sum of Boxes\" is used as a primary endpoint in early AD RCTs. Is it considered a marker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The context indicates it's a clinical outcome assessment (COA), not a biomarker. The instruction: \"Validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" The documents mention CDR-SB as a measure used in trials, but not necessarily a biomarker. The definition of biomarker: \"fluid-based and imaging biomarkers\" etc. CDR-SB is a clinical rating scale, not a biomarker. So likely invalid.

They mention A‑PET. Also abbreviation: PET. But the most known/used acronym mentioned in documents: A‑PET. Let's see: In text: \"Amyloid positron emission tomography scan: it has been able to distinguish abnormal from normal amyloid-­positron emission tomography (A‑PET) scans\". So acronym: A‑PET. Could also be PET. But choose A‑PET.\n\nSecond: 'Anti-Donanemab Antibodies: anti-drug antibody response'. This refers to anti-drug antibodies against donanemab. Are these considered a biomarker? The context mentions anti-drug antibody response in relation to donanemab. It might be a biomarker for drug exposure or immune response, but is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's disease itself? The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The document says \"anti-drug antibody response\" but doesn't say it's a biomarker for AD.

But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". Usually biomarkers include amyloid beta, tau, etc. Donanemab serum concentration is a pharmacokinetic parameter, not a disease biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut maybe the document says \"Donanemab Serum Concentration: average serum concentration at steady state\" as part of a marker list? It's about drug concentration. I think it's not a disease biomarker. So valid=false.\n\nSecond: vMRI: volumetric magnetic resonance imaging brain volume. The context includes many references to volumetric MRI as a biomarker for AD. Yes, it's recognized. Acronym: vMRI? They refer to \"volumetric MRI\" or \"vMRI\".

And provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe should strictly rely on the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst item: \"Flortaucipir-18F: flortaucipir PET uptake (SUVr)\" appears in the document. There are references: \"Wolters E, Dodich A, Boccardi M,, et al. Clinical validity of increased cortical uptake of 18F-Flortaucipir as a biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease in the context of a structured 5-phase development framework.\" Also earlier: \"Context for Flortaucipir-18F: flortaucipir PET uptake (SUVr):...\". So yes, it's a recognized marker. Acronym? The abbreviation used is \"18F-Flortaucipir\" maybe \"Flortaucipir-18F\". But the question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For Flortaucipir-18F, the abbreviation might be \"18F-Flortaucipir\" or just \"Flortaucipir\". But the document uses \"18F-Flortaucipir\" as the tracer name. It also refers to \"Flortaucipir PET uptake (SUVr)\". The acronym could be \"Flortaucipir\" or \"18F-Flortaucipir\". There's no separate acronym like \"FT\". So likely \"Flortaucipir-18F\" itself is the marker name. But the instruction says: Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation. For Flortaucipir-18F, the abbreviation is \"18F-Flortaucipir\". That seems fine.\n\nSecond item: \"SUVr: Standard Uptake Value Ratio\". Is this a recognized marker? It's a measurement metric used in PET imaging. The context indicates that SUVr is used as a quantitative measure of tracer uptake. It is used for measuring flortaucipir PET uptake etc. But is SUVr considered a marker for Alzheimer's? It's a measurement, not a biological marker per se. The context says \"Standard Uptake Value Ratio:...\". It is used to quantify PET uptake. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention SUVr as a measurement used for PET imaging of AD biomarkers. But is it a marker? It is a metric used to assess biomarker levels. The context includes \"Standard Uptake Value Ratio:...\". It doesn't say it's a marker itself. It is a measurement. The user wants to know if it's recognized marker. According to the documents, SUVr is used to quantify uptake of flortaucipir and amyloid PET. But is it considered a marker? The documents treat it as a measurement of biomarker uptake. It may not be considered a biomarker itself. The user says \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". I'd lean that SUVr is not a biomarker but a measurement. So we should mark it as invalid. But let's double-check: The context includes \"Standard Uptake Value Ratio:...\". It says \"Standard Uptake Value Ratio: ce not being affected by small variations...\". It is used for scaling. It is a metric. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents do not explicitly call SUVr a marker. They refer to it as a measurement. So we mark it as invalid.\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects.\n\nFor first object: original_name: \"Flortaucipir-18F: flortaucipir PET uptake (SUVr)\", valid:true, acronym:\"18F-Flortaucipir\".\n\nSecond: original_name:\"SUVr: Standard Uptake Value Ratio\", valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\".\n\nReturn JSON array.

We must check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info from the provided context. Let's search the context for these names.\n\nFirst: 'Perceived Stress Scale' appears multiple times. In the context, we see \"Context for PS: Perceived Stress Scale: Type not listed\" etc. It seems it's a measure but not necessarily a biomarker. It's a psychological scale measuring stress. Is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The document lists many measures, but I don't see mention that Perceived Stress Scale is a biomarker. It's likely not a biomarker. So valid = false.\n\nBut maybe the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" could refer to a biomarker like CSF amyloid beta, etc. The Perceived Stress Scale is not a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nSecond: 'RMC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist'. This appears in the context: \"Context for RMC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist\". It is described as a checklist for memory and behavior problems. But is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? It might be a neuropsychological assessment tool, not a biomarker. The context says \"The RBANS is for use in both clinical practice and research settings.\" Wait that's RBANS. For RMC, there is description: \"The RMC is for use over a wide range of cognitive status, from normal to moderate AD.... Diagnostic accuracy for both clinical AD and MCI due to AD have been demonstrated.\" That suggests it can detect AD. But is it a marker? It's a behavioral assessment, not a biological marker. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents talk about fluid-based and imaging biomarkers, but also mention various tests. However, the term \"marker\" may include cognitive tests? Usually markers are biological. But the instruction: \"Your task is to analyze a list of potential markers extracted from datasets and validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" And earlier: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" So we need to see if the document states that RMC is a marker. The context says \"Diagnostic accuracy for both clinical AD and MCI due to AD have been demonstrated.\" That implies it's a diagnostic tool. But is it a marker? Might be considered a marker. But the question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For RMC, abbreviation is RMC itself. But maybe the full name is \"Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist\". The acronym RMC is given. So we should output:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"PS: Perceived Stress Scale\",\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"acronym\": \"N/A\"\n}\n\nAnd for RMC:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"RMC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist\",\n  \"valid\": true,\n  \"acronym\": \"RMC\"\n}\n\nBut we need to confirm if RMC is indeed considered a marker. The context: \"Context for RMC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist: sions of the test exist, to counteract practice effects... The measure was designed for use over a wide range of cognitive status, from normal to moderate AD.... Diagnostic accuracy for both clinical AD and MCI due to AD have been demonstrated.\" That indicates it's a validated tool for diagnosing AD. So yes, it's a marker.\n\nThus produce JSON array? The required format: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably separate objects. Could output array of objects. The instruction: \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" then shows object. So we can output an array of objects. Or just separate lines? Likely array.\n\nLet's produce:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"PS: Perceived Stress Scale\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"RMC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist\",\"valid\":true,\"acronym\":\"RMC\"}\n]\n\nCheck that we didn't add extra keys.

The documents mention CES-D multiple times. It appears in the table of measures. It's listed under \"Context for CES-D: Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale\". It seems it's used as a measure but is it a biomarker? It's a depression scale, not a biological marker. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" could refer to any marker including clinical scales? In the context, CES-D is listed among measures like ADAS-Cog etc. These are outcome measures, not necessarily biomarkers. The instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The documents mention fluid-based and imaging biomarkers separately. CES-D is a psychometric instrument, not a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut we should see if the document states CES-D is used as a marker. The tables show \"Measure name\", type of COAa, disease severity, frequency. For CES-D, there is no entry in the table? Actually I saw \"Context for CES-D: Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale: Type not listed\" earlier. That suggests it's a measure but maybe not a biomarker. The question: \"Based strictly on the information provided in the context above, for each item in the list determine: - If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; - The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" So we need to decide validity based on documents.\n\nLet's search for CES-D in the context. There's a line: \"Context for CES-D: Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale: Type not listed\". Also later: \"Context for CES-D: Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale: sease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC)\". That seems garbled. But still indicates CES-D is a measure. Not sure if it's considered a marker. The document lists many measures: ADAS-Cog, MMSE, etc. They are outcome measures, not biomarkers. The question might treat these as markers. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The context includes \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in AD clinical trials\" section listing CSF amyloid beta, tau, etc. Then separate list of clinical outcome assessments. So CES-D is not a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nNow ERP P300: The context mentions \"Event‑related potential P300 latency\" as a biomarker. There is a section about ERP P300 latency, referencing studies tracking pathophysiological processes. It also mentions \"plasma p-tau217\" etc. But ERP P300 latency is discussed as a biomarker. So yes, recognized marker. Acronym: P300? Or ERP P300? The most known abbreviation is P300. The document uses \"ERP P300 latency\" and refers to \"P300\". So acronym: P300.\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects.\n\nFirst object: original_name: 'CES-D: Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale', valid: false, acronym: 'N/A'\n\nSecond: original_name: 'ERP P300: Event‑related potential P300 latency', valid: true, acronym: 'P300'\n\nReturn as JSON array.

    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want us to analyze two items: 'rs-fMRI: Resting‑state functional magnetic resonance imaging' and 'Florbetaben-18F: tracer used in PET scan to quantify amyloid load'. We must determine if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info from the provided context. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, there is mention of rs-fMRI: \"Context for rs-fMRI: Resting‑state functional magnetic resonance imaging: Type not listed\" etc. It appears in the table. But we need to see if it's considered a recognized marker. The context says \"Resting‑state functional magnetic resonance imaging: Type not listed\". There's no explicit statement that rs-fMRI is a recognized biomarker. It's just a measure type. The document references \"resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging\" but doesn't say it's a biomarker. So likely not validated as a marker per the documents. However, maybe the context includes \"fluid-based and imaging biomarkers\" section referencing PET tracers like Florbetaben-18F. That definitely is a biomarker. For rs-fMRI, there's no mention of its role as a biomarker. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nNow for Florbetaben-18F: The context states \"tracer used in PET scan to quantify amyloid load\". And many references about PET imaging, amyloid positivity, etc. So yes, it's a recognized biomarker. Acronym? The abbreviation given is \"Florbetaben-18F\". Usually abbreviated as \"FB-18F\"? But the context uses \"Florbetaben-18F\" itself. There might be an abbreviation like \"FB-18F\" or \"Florbetaben\". But the context lists \"Florbetaben-18F: tracer used in PET scan to quantify amyloid load\". No other acronym. Maybe \"Aβ-PET\" but that's generic. The context also mentions \"Aβ-PET\" as \"amyloid-positron emission tomography\". But the specific tracer is Florbetaben-18F. The acronym could be \"FB-18F\" but not explicitly stated. The instruction: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" The document uses \"Florbetaben-18F\" as full name. It doesn't provide an abbreviation. So we can set acronym to \"Florbetaben-18F\" or \"FB-18F\"? Since not present, maybe \"N/A\"? But the requirement: If element is valid, provide acronym. If not, \"N/A\". For Florbetaben-18F, it's valid, so we need an acronym. The document uses \"Florbetaben-18F\" as the name. It might be considered the acronym itself. But the instruction: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" The document refers to \"Florbetaben-18F\" as the tracer. It doesn't abbreviate further. So we can use \"Florbetaben-18F\" as the acronym. Or maybe \"FB-18F\" but not in text. I'd choose \"Florbetaben-18F\".\n\nBut let's double-check if any other acronyms appear: The context includes \"Aβ-PET\", \"FDG-PET\", \"tau-PET\", \"SUVr\", \"APOE\", \"NfL\", \"t-tau\", \"p-tau181\", \"p-tau217\". None refer to Florbetaben specifically. So the best is \"Florbetaben-18F\".\n\nThus produce JSON objects:\n\nFirst object: original_name: 'rs-fMRI: Resting‑state functional magnetic resonance imaging', valid: false, acronym: 'N/A'.\n\nSecond object: original_name: 'Florbetaben-18F: tracer used in PET scan to quantify amyloid load', valid: true, acronym: 'Florbetaben-18F'.\n\nReturn array of these objects? The spec says \"For each element, use this JSON structure:\" It didn't specify array but likely multiple objects separated by comma. We'll output as array.\n\nLet's craft final answer.",

The documents mention ARIA-H and ARIA-E as contexts. But are they considered markers? Let's read the context.\n\nThe first part: \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-related imaging abnormality – hemosiderin deposition: ful accuracy.\" It seems to describe ARIA-H as a type of imaging abnormality. The text says: \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-related imaging abnormality – hemosiderin deposition: ful accuracy.\" Then later: \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-related imaging abnormality – hemosiderin deposition: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum\". So ARIA-H appears to be a term used in the document. Similarly, ARIA-E: \"Amyloid-related imaging abnormality – edema\".\n\nBut the question: Are these recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents? The documents talk about ARIA-H and ARIA-E as imaging abnormalities associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. They might be considered markers? The context includes \"ful accuracy\" etc. But the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\"\n\nSo we need to see if the documents provide evidence that ARIA-H and ARIA-E are recognized markers. The documents mention them as \"Amyloid-related imaging abnormality – hemosiderin deposition\" and \"Amyloid-related imaging abnormality – edema\". They appear to be specific types of ARIA. Are they considered markers? The documents treat them as categories of ARIA. They may be considered markers of ARIA, which is a side effect of anti-amyloid therapy. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" - maybe they are not directly markers of AD but rather complications. However, the documents refer to them as \"context for ARIA-H\" etc. There's no explicit statement that ARIA-H or ARIA-E are recognized markers for AD. They are just described as imaging abnormalities. The question likely expects that they are not recognized markers for AD per se. But let's examine the context again.\n\nFirst paragraph: \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-related imaging abnormality – hemosiderin deposition: ful accuracy. A meta-analysis by Yuan et al., which included 24 studies with a total of 1112 patients, found sensitivity and specificity values of 89% and 85% for PET, 84% and 70% for SPECT, and 73% and 81% for MRI, respectively, for prediction of conversion from MCI to AD [35]. These imaging tests have been successful in differentiating AD from MCI. On the other hand, PET scans show higher positivity for amyloid (A+) with increasing age, but this does not necessarily correspond to memory impairment or other cognitive conditions. Thus, visual interpretation of structural images cannot reliably identify patients with presymptomatic conditions before MCI [36].\"\n\nThis paragraph mentions ARIA-H but then goes into general imaging tests. It doesn't say ARIA-H is a marker. It's just context heading.\n\nSecond paragraph: \"3.2. High Invasive Biomarkers... The biomarker related to Aβ in CSF is called (Aβ42)...\"\n\nThird: \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-related imaging abnormality – hemosiderin deposition: Biomarker profiles combining amyloid, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration lie along an AD or non-AD continuum...\"\n\nFourth: \"Context for ARIA-E: Amyloid-related imaging abnormality – edema: ful accuracy. A meta-analysis by Yuan et al., which included 24 studies with a total of 1112 patients, found sensitivity and specificity values of 89% and 85% for PET, 84% and 70% for SPECT, and 73% and 81% for MRI, respectively, for prediction of conversion from MCI to AD [35]...\"\n\nThus, ARIA-H and ARIA-E are not explicitly stated as markers. They are types of ARIA. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents; The most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" So we need to decide if each is recognized marker. Based on the documents, there is no direct claim that ARIA-H or ARIA-E are recognized markers for AD. They are imaging abnormalities associated with amyloid therapy. They might be considered markers of ARIA, not AD itself. So I'd set valid=false for both.\n\nBut we should double-check if the documents mention ARIA-H or ARIA-E as markers. The headings \"Context for ARIA-H:\" suggests it's a context section. But the content under that heading includes general info about imaging tests predicting conversion from MCI to AD. That could imply ARIA-H is a marker? No, it's just a heading. The heading might be mis-labeled. But the phrase \"Context for ARIA-H: Amyloid-related imaging abnormality – hemosiderin deposition\" indicates ARIA-H is a type of ARIA. The question: \"Recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" I think ARIA-H/E are not markers for AD.

Let's examine the context for BUN: There's mention of BUN: Blood Urea Nitrogen: \"Blood Urea Nitrogen: ance as evidence evolves.\" It's part of a paragraph about emerging paradigms such as biomarker combinations or ratios and multi-threshold testing that may refine diagnostic accuracy of BBMs. So BUN is considered a blood-based biomarker?

The user wants to analyze two items: 'Neuro-QOL PAW: Neuro‑QOL v1.0 Positive Affect and Well‑Being Short Form' and 'MAIA-2 SR: MAIA‑2 Self‑Regulation Subscale'.\n\nWe need to check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention various measures like QoL-AD, EQ-5D-5L, etc. They also mention Neuro-QOL PAW? Let's search context: There's mention of \"Neuro-QOL PAW: Neuro‑QOL v1.0 Positive Affect and Well‑Being Short Form\" in the first part. But is it listed as a marker? It's described as a positive affect and well-being short form. Is it a biomarker? No, it's a questionnaire measuring quality of life aspects. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The document lists \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers in AD clinical trials\" and \"Individual biomarkers summarized\" including CSF amyloid beta, tau, etc. Also mentions \"COAs/endpoints\" like ADAS-Cog, etc. Neuro-QOL PAW appears to be a PRO (patient reported outcome) measure, not a biomarker. So likely not a recognized marker. The second item: MAIA-2 SR: MAIA‑2 Self‑Regulation Subscale. That seems to be a psychological instrument too. Not a biomarker. The context references a review about biomarkers for AD, but doesn't mention MAIA-2 SR as a biomarker. So both are invalid markers.\n\nBut we need to provide acronym. For Neuro-QOL PAW: maybe abbreviation is \"Neuro-QOL PAW\"? Or \"PAW\"? The document uses \"Neuro-QOL PAW: Neuro‑QOL v1.0 Positive Affect and Well‑Being Short Form\". Acronym could be \"Neuro-QOL PAW\" or just \"PAW\". But since it's not a recognized marker, we set valid false and acronym \"N/A\".\n\nSimilarly for MAIA-2 SR: acronym \"MAIA-2 SR\". But again invalid.\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines? The instruction says: For each element, use JSON structure. Probably produce array of objects.

Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must only use info from the documents. Let's examine the context.\n\nFirst, there is mention of SC-90-R: Symptom Checklist‑90‑Revised (3‑Item Subset). It appears multiple times: \"Context for SC-90-R: Symptom Checklist‑90‑Revised (3‑Item Subset): Type not listed\" etc. But is SC-90-R considered a biomarker? The document seems to talk about endpoints in AD clinical trials, but SC-90-R is a symptom checklist, likely a patient-reported outcome measure. It's not a biomarker per se. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". According to the documents, SC-90-R is not listed as a biomarker. There's no mention of it being a biomarker. So it's probably invalid.\n\nBut let's check if there's any mention of SC-90-R as a biomarker. The text says \"Context for SC-90-R: Symptom Checklist‑90‑Revised (3‑Item Subset): Type not listed\". That suggests it's not a biomarker type. So we should mark it as invalid.\n\nSecond, GAIN: Gain in Alzheimer Care Instrument. There is mention: \"Gain in Alzheimer Care Instrument: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al.\" Also earlier: \"GAIN: Gain in Alzheimer Care Instrument: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al. Tracking pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease: an updated hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers.\" Wait that's a citation. Actually the snippet shows \"GAIN: Gain in Alzheimer Care Instrument: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al.\" Might be referencing a paper. But is GAIN a biomarker? The instrument might be a tool measuring something like caregiver burden? Not sure. The context includes \"GAIN: Gain in Alzheimer Care Instrument: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al. Tracking pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease: an updated hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers.\" That seems to refer to a paper about dynamic biomarkers, maybe GAIN is a biomarker? But the instrument itself may be a measure of something else. However, the user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention GAIN in the context of \"Gain in Alzheimer Care Instrument\" but do they say it's a biomarker? Let's search the context again.\n\nScrolling: \"Context for GAIN: Gain in Alzheimer Care Instrument: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al. Tracking pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease: an updated hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers.\" That looks like a citation line where GAIN is the first author? No, \"man DS, Jagust WJ, et al.\" could be authors. But the phrase \"GAIN: Gain in Alzheimer Care Instrument:\" preceding that indicates that GAIN stands for \"Gain in Alzheimer Care Instrument\". Then the next part \"man DS, Jagust WJ, et al.\" might be authors of a different paper. Hard to parse.\n\nAlso later: \"GAIN: Gain in Alzheimer Care Instrument: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al. Tracking pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease: an updated hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers.\" That seems to be a reference to a paper titled \"Tracking pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease: an updated hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers\" by authors including Jagust WJ. But GAIN is not necessarily a biomarker.\n\nAdditionally, earlier: \"GAIN: Gain in Alzheimer Care Instrument: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al.\" Could be a footnote referencing a paper about GAIN.

Tracking pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease: an updated hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers. Lancet Neurol. 2013;12(2):207–216.\"\n\nSo the sentence: \"GAIN: Gain in Alzheimer Care Instrument: man DS, Jagust WJ, et al. Tracking pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease: an updated hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers.\" It seems like the authors of the paper are \"Man DS, Jagust WJ, et al.\" The title is \"Tracking pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer’s disease: an updated hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers.\" So GAIN is not part of the title. Maybe GAIN is a separate instrument referenced elsewhere. But the context doesn't explicitly state that GAIN is a biomarker. It just mentions the instrument.\n\nThus, based on the documents, we cannot confirm that GAIN is a recognized biomarker. It might be a tool/instrument, but not a biomarker. So we would mark it as invalid too.\n\nHowever, the user specifically asks: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So both likely invalid.\n\nBut we also need to provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.

The instruction: \"If an element is NOT a valid marker, indicate: { \"original_name\": \"...\", \"valid\": false, \"acronym\": \"N/A\" }\"\n\nSo for invalid ones, acronym = \"N/A\".\n\nThus output will be array of two objects.\n\nCheck formatting: Each object has keys original_name, valid, acronym.

But they ask \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" In the document, they refer to \"plasma t-tau\" sometimes. Let's search context: \"plasma t-tau\" appears in the excerpt: \"Biomarker: plasma t-tau, plasma p-tau181, and NfL\". So abbreviation \"t-tau\". Also earlier \"Total tau: pg/ml\".

Another snippet: \"Context for CSF Lactate: Cerebrospinal fluid lactate concentration: ce not being aﬀected by small variations introduced through pre-analytical, analytical, batch-to-batch, and lot-to-lot variability.\" This indicates reliability. But still not clear if it's a marker for AD.\n\nAlso later: \"Context for CSF Lactate: Cerebrospinal fluid lactate concentration: and PP patients were identified by the metabolite markers glucosylgalactosyl, hydroxylysine—H2O, and Glutamine-carnitine (discovery phase (DP) and validation phase (VP): area under the curve [AUC] = 1.000, AUC = 1.000 with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity).\" This refers to metabolite markers, but not specifically CSF lactate. It lists other metabolites. Then: \"In addition, using positively confirmed metabolites, we distinguished AD from PP and MCI with good diagnostic performance (AUC > 0.8) [47].\"\n\nThus CSF lactate may not be highlighted as a marker. The context also mentions \"lactoferrin LF\" as a biomarker. But not CSF lactate.\n\nTherefore likely CSF lactate is not recognized as a marker for AD in these documents. So valid: false.\n\nNow SBP: Systolic blood pressure. Is it a recognized marker for AD? The context includes references to guidelines and blood biomarkers. But SBP is a physiological measure, not a biomarker. The context does not mention SBP as a marker for AD. So invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"SBP: Systolic blood pressure: he Terms and Conditions...\". It's just a header. No mention of SBP as a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects.\n\nNeed to provide acronym: For CSF Lactate, if invalid, acronym \"N/A\". For SBP, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nReturn JSON array?

Use JSON format per system instructions.\n\nWe must check the documents content. The context includes multiple references to plasma biomarkers, but specifically mentions \"M6/CP199 plasma concentration\" as part of a paper about plasma concentration. It seems like a specific marker? Let's search the text: \"M6/CP199 plasma concentration\". It's referenced in the first paragraph: \"Context for M6/CP199-Conc: M6/CP199 plasma concentration: Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports 7 (2023) 355–380 DOI 10.3233/ADR-230029 IOS Press 355 Review Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease: A Review...\" So it's a marker studied in that paper. But is it recognized as a marker? The document says \"M6/CP199 plasma concentration\" is a marker? The context doesn't explicitly say it's validated as a marker. It just says it's a plasma concentration studied. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents mention it as a plasma biomarker. That suggests yes. But we need to see if there's evidence that it's recognized. The context says \"Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease:... Many studies have established...\". It might include M6/CP199. But we don't have explicit validation. But the context states \"M6/CP199 plasma concentration\" appears in the title of a paper. That implies it's considered a biomarker. So we can consider it valid.\n\nNow the acronym: The marker's name is \"M6/CP199-Conc: M6/CP199 plasma concentration\". The acronym would be \"M6/CP199\". Or maybe \"M6/CP199-Conc\"? The abbreviation used in the document is \"M6/CP199-Conc\". But they ask for the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. The document uses \"M6/CP199-Conc\" as the label. So we can use that.\n\nSecond item: 'AE: Adverse Event count'. Is that a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? No, adverse event count is not a biomarker. It's a safety endpoint. The documents mention AE: Adverse Event count in context of safety biomarkers. But it's not a biomarker for Alzheimer's. So it's invalid.

This appears in the document context: \"Context for DAE: Discontinuation due to Adverse Event: riers are at greater risk...\" etc. It's about discontinuation due to adverse event. Is this a marker for Alzheimer's? No, it's a term describing a type of adverse event leading to discontinuation of therapy. Not a biomarker. So it's not a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. So valid = false, acronym = \"N/A\". But maybe they might consider DAE as a marker? However, the question says \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" meaning a biomarker. DAE is not a biomarker. So invalid.\n\nSecond item: 'MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination'. The context includes many references to MMSE. It is a cognitive test used as a measure of cognitive impairment, used in inclusion criteria for AD clinical trials. It is indeed a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. So valid = true.

The context includes mention of FMRI: \"Context for FMRI: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Type not listed\" etc. Also references to \"Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: 14–29. [32]\" etc. There's mention of structural imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease: predicting disease progression. But is FMRI considered a recognized marker? The context says \"Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Type not listed\". It seems it's a type of imaging modality, but not necessarily a biomarker itself. However, the question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" We need to check if FMRI is described as a biomarker. The context mentions \"Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Type not listed\" and \"Context for FMRI: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: 14–29. [32]\". There is no explicit statement that FMRI is a recognized biomarker. It's just a method. So likely invalid.\n\nBut we should double-check: Are there any statements like \"FMRI is a biomarker\"? The context shows \"Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Type not listed\" under some table. That suggests it's a type of measurement but not a biomarker. The document might treat FMRI as a measurement type rather than a biomarker. So I'd say not a recognized marker.\n\nSecond: \"ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\". The context contains many references to ADAS-Cog. It is definitely a recognized marker. The acronym is ADAS-Cog. The full name is given.

Let's examine the context.\n\nThe context includes many acronyms and mentions of various measures. It lists \"C-SSRS\" as \"Columbia‑Suicide Severity Rating Scale\". It also lists \"CDR-SB\" as \"Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes\". But are they considered markers? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's.\" In the context, C-SSRS is a safety outcome used across psychiatry to measure suicidal ideation and behavior. It's not a biomarker for Alzheimer's. The document says it's not specifically validated in elderly population and concerns about its appropriateness for dementia. So likely not a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. So valid: false.\n\nBut the user might consider \"marker\" meaning \"endpoint\" or \"measure\"? The context says \"Fluid-based & imaging biomarkers in AD clinical trials\" but C-SSRS is not a fluid-based or imaging biomarker. It's a clinical rating scale. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents mention C-SSRS as a safety outcome, not a biomarker. So I'd say not a recognized marker. So valid: false.\n\nWhat about CDR-SB? The context states that CDR-SB is a clinician-reported assessment of cognition and function, used as a primary endpoint in early AD RCTs. It is used to assess disease progression. Is it considered a marker? It is a clinical assessment tool, not a biomarker. But the question may treat it as a marker because it's used as an endpoint. The context says \"Clinician-reported outcome\" and \"Performance outcome\" etc. The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents refer to CDR-SB as a measurement used in AD clinical trials. It is indeed a recognized measure for AD.

For CDR-SB, acronym is \"CDR-SB\".\n\nBut the system instructions: \"Provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" So yes.\n\nEdge: The original names contain colon and description.

So we need to see whether these items appear as markers in the documents. Let's scan the context.\n\nFirst, there is mention of \"rs-fMRI: resting state functional MRI\" in the table. It says \"Context for rs-fMRI: resting state functional MRI: Type not listed\". That seems like it's a type of measure. But is it considered a marker? The context indicates it's a measure type, but not necessarily a biomarker. There's also mention of \"structural imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease: predicting disease progression.\" That refers to structural imaging biomarkers. Also \"resting state functional MRI\" might be considered a biomarker? The document references \"Context for rs-fMRI: resting state functional MRI: onov VS, Pruessner JC, Collins DL, Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.\" That appears to be a citation. But is rs-fMRI considered a recognized marker? The text doesn't explicitly say it's a marker. It's just a type of measure. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention \"structural imaging biomarkers\" and \"resting state functional MRI\" maybe as part of imaging biomarkers. But do they call it a marker? Not sure. The context includes \"Structural imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease: predicting disease progression.\" That suggests structural imaging biomarkers are recognized. But rs-fMRI is a type of functional MRI, not structural. However, the context says \"Context for rs-fMRI: resting state functional MRI: Type not listed\". That implies it's a type of measure but not listed as a specific biomarker. So likely it's not validated as a marker per se. So we would mark it as invalid.\n\nSecond item: \"TGd Abnormal Connections: TGd parcellation abnormal connections count\". The context mentions \"TGd parcellation abnormal connections count\" multiple times. It says \"TGd Abnormal Connections: TGd parcellation abnormal connections count\". There is discussion about \"TGd parcellation abnormal connections count\" being a measure. It says \"Large variability in use depending on practice patterns... strongly reflects clinical trial outcomes and key features of AD; pre vs post change could be useful... As it is measurable, it can show the level of decline, but it must be combined with amyloid biomarkers... Reflective of patient outcomes (assuming correct diagnosis of AD)\". So it seems to be considered a marker. The acronym \"TGd\" stands for something? The context uses \"TGd\" but doesn't expand it. It might stand for \"Tractography-derived\"? Not sure. But the acronym used is \"TGd\". The item itself is \"TGd Abnormal Connections: TGd parcellation abnormal connections count\". So the acronym is \"TGd\". The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" For the first item, \"rs-fMRI: resting state functional MRI\", the abbreviation is \"rs-fMRI\". For the second, \"TGd Abnormal Connections: TGd parcellation abnormal connections count\", the abbreviation is \"TGd\".\n\nBut we need to check if the documents mention \"rs-fMRI\" as a marker. The context shows \"Context for rs-fMRI: resting state functional MRI: Type not listed\". That suggests it's not listed as a marker. So we mark it as invalid.

It's a behavioral assessment tool. The context lists it among observer-reported outcomes. It might be considered a marker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". Usually markers refer to biomarkers like CSF amyloid, tau, imaging. But the context may treat NPI-C as a marker?

But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\" likely refers to biomarkers like CSF amyloid, tau, etc. SDI is not a biomarker; it's a questionnaire about sleep disorders. So probably not considered a marker. The context says \"Sleep Disorder Inventory: Type not listed\". Not sure if it's a biomarker. The instruction: \"validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" So we need to check if the documents mention them as markers. For SDI: I don't see explicit mention that it's a marker. It's just a measure. So likely invalid.\n\nFor NPI-C: Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician rating. The context includes \"NPI-C: Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician rating\" and also mentions \"NPI-Q\" and \"NPI\" etc. The NPI is a neuropsychiatric inventory. But is it a marker? It's a behavioral assessment tool. The context lists it among observer-reported outcomes. It might be considered a marker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". Usually markers refer to biomarkers like CSF amyloid, tau, imaging. But the context may treat NPI-C as a marker? The context shows \"NPI-C: Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician rating\" as part of endpoints. But is it a marker? The context doesn't explicitly say it's a biomarker. It is a measurement instrument. The question: \"If it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The documents mention NPI-C as a measure used in AD trials. But is it a marker? Might be considered a clinical outcome assessment rather than a biomarker. The instruction: \"marker/biomarker\". So likely NPI-C is not a biomarker either. However, the context includes \"Fluid-based and imaging biomarkers\" section listing CSF amyloid, tau, etc. No mention of NPI-C there. So I'd consider NPI-C not a biomarker. So both invalid.\n\nBut we need to provide acronym. For SDI: Sleep Disorder Inventory. Acronym: SDI. For NPI-C: Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician rating. Acronym: NPI-C. Provide JSON objects accordingly.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"SDI: Sleep Disorder Inventory\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"SDI\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"NPI-C: Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician rating\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"NPI-C\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines?

We have two items: 'CMAI-C: Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory-Community Version' and 'Seltorexant Plasma Concentration: plasma level of seltorexant'.\n\nWe need to check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to documents. The documents mention CMAI-C as a measure name in Table 1. It appears under \"Measure name\" column. It's listed as \"Cohen-Mansfeld Agitation Inventory (CMAI)\" but also earlier \"Context for CMAI-C: Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory-Community Version\". So it's a measurement instrument, not a biomarker per se. But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents\". The document lists many measures including CMAI. Are these considered markers? They are outcome measures, not biomarkers. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The context includes many measures like ADAS-Cog, MMSE, etc. These are clinical assessment tools, not biomarkers. However, the question might consider them as markers. The instruction: \"Your task is to analyze a list of potential markers extracted from datasets and validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" So we need to see if each element is actually a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's. The documents show CMAI-C as a measure used in studies. Is it a recognized marker? Possibly yes, as agitation is a symptom. But is it a biomarker? Not a biological marker. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". Could include clinical scales. But the context shows \"Measure name\" table. So maybe they are considered markers. The second item: Seltorexant Plasma Concentration: plasma level of seltorexant. This is a drug concentration, not a biomarker. The context mentions \"plasma level of seltorexant: adigm for advancing from discovery to clinic.\" But no evidence that it's a marker for Alzheimer's. It's a pharmacokinetic measure. So likely invalid.\n\nThus output JSON array with objects.\n\nFirst object: original_name: 'CMAI-C: Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory-Community Version'. valid: true? Need to decide.

Use only info given.\n\nFirst item: M12: Metabolite M12. Context includes references to \"Metabolite M12\" in several citations. But is it described as a marker? Let's see: The first context says \"Metabolite M12: The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease 12 (2025) 100056\". That seems like a paper title referencing metabolite M12. Another context: \"Context for M12: Metabolite M12: Citation: Gunes, S.;... Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in the Current State: A Narrative Review.\" So M12 appears in a review about biomarkers. Also \"Context for M12: Metabolite M12: 4] Jia J, Ning Y, Chen M, Wang S, Yang H, Li F, et al. Biomarker changes during 20 years preceding Alzheimer’s disease.\" So M12 might be a metabolite studied as a biomarker. However, do we have explicit mention that M12 is a recognized marker? The document excerpts don't explicitly say it's validated. They just mention it as part of a study. There's no acronym given. So likely invalid.\n\nSecond item: Amyloid PET: amyloid positron emission tomography signal. The context clearly describes amyloid PET as a biomarker, mentions Aβ, etc. It is definitely a recognized marker. Acronym: PET stands for Positron Emission Tomography. But the specific term \"Amyloid PET\" could be abbreviated as \"Aβ-PET\" or \"amyloid PET\". The context uses \"amyloid-PET\" sometimes. The acronym maybe \"Aβ-PET\" or simply \"PET\". The question: \"most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\" In the context, they refer to \"amyloid-PET\" and \"Aβ-PET\"? Let's search: In the excerpt: \"Amyloid PET: amyloid positron emission tomography signal\". They also mention \"Aβ-PET\" earlier? Actually reading: \"It has been able to distinguish abnormal from normal amyloid-positron emission tomography (A‑PET) scans...\" So abbreviation A‑PET. Also later \"Aβ-PET\" maybe.

Ensure hyphen is correct. Might use \"A-PET\" but context uses \"A‑PET\" with en dash. Use plain ASCII: \"APET\" maybe. But better to use \"A-PET\". The context uses \"A‑PET\" with a dash.

They want us to analyze two items:\n\n1. \"ADCS-ADL-MCI: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living in Mild Cognitive Impairment\"\n\n2. \"GST: Global Statistical Test composite z‑score\"\n\nWe must determine if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. And provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only info from the provided context. So we cannot bring outside knowledge.\n\nLet's examine the context.\n\nFirst, many lines mention ADCS-ADL-MCI. For example:\n\n\"ADCS-ADL-MCI: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living in Mild Cognitive Impairment\" appears in the list at top. Also later: \"ADCS-ADL-MCI Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study–Activities of Daily Living Inventory–MCI (speciﬁc)\" etc. It seems it's a measure used in clinical trials, but is it a biomarker? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The context includes that ADCS-ADL-MCI is a clinical outcome assessment (COA) measuring functional ability. It's not a biological biomarker like CSF tau. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". However, the context lists many measures, some are cognitive tests, some are functional scales. Are these considered markers? The context indicates they are \"clinical outcome assessments\" used in trials. The question might consider them as markers because they assess disease status. But the phrase \"biomarker\" usually refers to measurable indicators of disease state, often biological. But the user specifically says \"potential Alzheimer's markers\" and wants to validate them. The context includes ADCS-ADL-MCI as a measure. There's no explicit statement that it's a biomarker. But the context says \"ADCS-ADL-MCI... is a measure.\" It doesn't say it's a biomarker. But maybe the user expects that ADCS-ADL-MCI is indeed a recognized marker. Let's see if the document states \"ADCS-ADL-MCI is a recognized marker\". Search: The context shows \"ADCS-ADL-MCI\" appears in the list of measures. There is no explicit claim that it's a biomarker. But the user may treat it as a marker. The instruction: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The context includes references to ADCS-ADL-MCI as a measure used in AD trials. That qualifies as a marker? Possibly yes. The context also mentions \"ADCS-ADL-MCI\" under \"Measure name\" and \"Type of COA\" etc. So we can say it's a recognized marker. The acronym would be \"ADCS-ADL-MCI\".\n\nNow for \"GST: Global Statistical Test composite z‑score\". The context includes \"GST: Global Statistical Test composite z‑score\" in the list of measures. It appears in the table. It is described as a measure. But is it a recognized marker? The context says \"GST: Global Statistical Test composite z‑score\" appears in the table. But there's no mention of it being a biomarker. It's likely a statistical method rather than a biomarker. The context says \"Global Statistical Test composite z‑score\" but no further explanation. The user asks: \"If a marker is not mentioned in the provided documents or does not have sufficient evidence in the context, mark it as invalid.\" So we need to check if the context provides enough evidence that GST is a recognized marker. The context just lists it as a measure. But does it say it's correlated with AD? Not explicitly. It might be a composite score used in trials. But the context doesn't give evidence. So we should probably mark it as invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check: The context includes \"GST: Global Statistical Test composite z‑score\" in the table. The table lists \"Measure name\" and \"Type of COA\" etc. Under \"Measure name\" we see \"GST: Global Statistical Test composite z‑score\". It appears in the table. But no description. The table includes columns: \"Disease severity\", \"Total frequency\", etc. The row for GST shows numbers. But no description. So we can't confirm it's a recognized marker. So we mark invalid.\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects.\n\nFor ADCS-ADL-MCI: valid true, acronym \"ADCS-ADL-MCI\".\n\nFor GST: valid false, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nReturn JSON array.

Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only the information provided in the context above. No external knowledge.\n\nLet's examine the context. There's a lot of text about various scales and tests: NADE: Negative Affect in Differential Emotions Scale appears in some lines: \"Context for NADE: Negative Affect in Differential Emotions Scale: Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder.\" Also later: \"Context for NADE: Negative Affect in Differential Emotions Scale: Type not listed\" etc. It seems NADE is a scale measuring negative affect. But is it a recognized biomarker for Alzheimer's? The context lists many scales like ADAS-Cog, MMSE, NPI, etc. NADE is not among typical biomarkers like CSF amyloid beta, tau, PET imaging. It's a psychological scale. The question: Are we supposed to consider it a marker? The instruction says: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" In the context, there is mention of NADE being used in a study: \"Negative Affect in Differential Emotions Scale: Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder.\" That suggests it's used in studies involving AD. But is it a recognized marker? The context doesn't explicitly say it's a biomarker. It might be a measurement tool. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention NADE in the context of a study comparing depression and AD. But no explicit statement that NADE is a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut maybe the document includes a table listing \"Measure name\" and \"Type of COAa\". For NADE, there's no entry. The tables show many measures: ADAS-Cog, MMSE, NPI, etc. NADE isn't listed. So probably not recognized as a marker.\n\nNow MAP: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System – Meaning and Purpose. The context mentions \"Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System – Meaning and Purpose\" as a heading. But again, is it a marker? It's a system for measuring patient-reported outcomes. Not a biomarker. The context also has \"MAP: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System – Meaning and Purpose\" as a list item. But the context shows \"MAP: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System – Meaning and Purpose\" appears in the list to validate. But the context also includes \"MAP: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System – Meaning and Purpose\" as a heading. However, the context does not mention MAP as a biomarker.

For NADE, the abbreviation is NADE itself. For MAP, the abbreviation is MAP.

    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want us to analyze the list of potential Alzheimer's markers and validate them using the information contained in the provided documents. The list contains two items: ['NADE: Negative Affect in Differential Emotions Scale', 'MAP: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System – Meaning and Purpose'].\n\nWe must check if these are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. Also provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents.\n\nWe must strictly use only the information provided in the context above. No external knowledge.\n\nLet's examine the context. There's a lot of text about various scales and tests: NADE: Negative Affect in Differential Emotions Scale appears in some lines: \"Context for NADE: Negative Affect in Differential Emotions Scale: Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder.\" Also later: \"Context for NADE: Negative Affect in Differential Emotions Scale: Type not listed\" etc. It seems NADE is a scale measuring negative affect. But is it a recognized biomarker for Alzheimer's? The context lists many scales like ADAS-Cog, MMSE, NPI, etc. NADE is not among typical biomarkers like CSF amyloid beta, tau, PET imaging. It's a psychological scale. The question: Are we supposed to consider it a marker? The instruction says: \"The marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" In the context, there is mention of NADE being used in a study: \"Negative Affect in Differential Emotions Scale: Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder.\" That suggests it's used in studies involving AD. But is it a recognized marker? The context doesn't explicitly say it's a biomarker. It might be a measurement tool. The user wants to know if it's a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. The documents mention NADE in the context of a study comparing depression and AD. But no explicit statement that NADE is a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut maybe the document includes a table listing \"Measure name\" and \"Type of COAa\". For NADE, there's no entry. The tables show many measures: ADAS-Cog, MMSE, NPI, etc. NADE isn't listed. So probably not recognized as a marker.\n\nNow MAP: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System – Meaning and Purpose. The context mentions \"Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System – Meaning and Purpose\" as a heading. But again, is it a marker? It's a system for measuring patient-reported outcomes. Not a biomarker. The context also has \"MAP: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System – Meaning and Purpose\" as a list item. But the context shows \"MAP: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System – Meaning and Purpose\" appears in the list to validate. But the context also includes \"MAP: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System – Meaning and Purpose\" as a heading. However, the context does not mention MAP as a biomarker. It's just a measurement system. So likely invalid.\n\nThus both are invalid markers.\n\nBut we need to provide the most known/used acronym/abbreviation mentioned in the documents. For NADE, the abbreviation is NADE itself. For MAP, the abbreviation is MAP. But the context may refer to \"MAP\" as \"Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System – Meaning and Purpose\". The abbreviation could be \"MAP\". But we should confirm if the abbreviation is used elsewhere. Search context: \"MAP:\" appears at top of list. There is no further usage. So we can set acronym = \"MAP\".\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects:\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"NADE: Negative Affect in Differential Emotions Scale\",\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"acronym\": \"NADE\"\n}\n\n{\n  \"original_name\": \"MAP: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System – Meaning and Purpose\",\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"acronym\": \"MAP\"\n}\n\nReturn as JSON array.

We have two items: 'OCBS-T: Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale – Time' and 'SUS: System Usability Scale'.\n\nWe need to check if they are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to documents. The documents mention various scales and measures. Let's search for 'Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale – Time'. In the context, I see \"OCBS-T: Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale – Time\" appears multiple times. It seems it's listed under \"ObsRO\" type. It's likely a caregiver burden measure. But is it a recognized marker for Alzheimer's? The question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The document lists many measures used in AD clinical trials. Some are biomarkers, but these are outcome measures. The question might treat these as markers? The instruction says \"validate them using the information contained in the provided documents.\" For each element, determine if it is actually a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's. So we need to see if the document states that these are markers. The context shows that OCBS-T is a measure used in AD studies. But is it a biomarker? It's a caregiver burden scale, not a biological marker. The document may consider it as a COA (clinical outcome assessment). But the question: \"recognized marker for Alzheimer's\". The context includes many measures like ADAS-Cog, etc. These are outcome measures, not necessarily biomarkers. However, the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The context doesn't explicitly label OCBS-T as a biomarker. It just lists it among other measures. So probably it's not a biomarker. Therefore, valid = false.\n\nBut maybe the question expects that these are recognized markers because they appear in the list of measures used in AD trials. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker\". The context includes many measures that are not biomarkers either. But the instruction says \"based strictly on the information provided\". So we should interpret whether the document identifies them as markers. The document does not say \"OCBS-T is a marker\". It only lists it as a measure. So I'd mark as invalid.\n\nSimilarly, SUS: System Usability Scale. That is a usability questionnaire, not a biomarker. Not mentioned as a marker. So invalid.\n\nThus output:\n\n[\n {\"original_name\":\"OCBS-T: Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale – Time\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"},\n {\"original_name\":\"SUS: System Usability Scale\",\"valid\":false,\"acronym\":\"N/A\"}\n]\n\nCheck formatting: Each object separate lines?

    },
    "cot": "We need to parse the user request carefully. They want us to analyze the list of potential Alzheimer's markers and validate them using the information contained in the provided documents. The list includes two items:\n\n1. 'RC-CRA: Role Captivity Sub-scale of Caregiver Reaction Assessment'\n2. \"ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale‑11‑item Cognitive Subscale\"\n\nWe need to check if these are recognized markers for Alzheimer's according to the documents. We should look at the context. The context contains many tables listing various measures, some labeled as \"ObsRO\", \"ClinRO\", etc. It lists \"RC-CRA: Role Captivity Sub-scale of Caregiver Reaction Assessment\" under \"Context for RC-CRA: Role Captivity Sub-scale of Caregiver Reaction Assessment\". In the table, we saw \"RC-CRA: Role Captivity Sub-scale of Caregiver Reaction Assessment\" listed as a measure name? Let's search. In the first part of the document, there is \"Context for RC-CRA: Role Captivity Sub-scale of Caregiver Reaction Assessment: stionnaire ObsRO 4 1 Attentive Matrices (AM)...\". That seems like a header. But later in the table, I don't see RC-CRA explicitly listed among the measures. However, earlier in the text, there's mention of \"RC-CRA: Role Captivity Sub-scale of Caregiver Reaction Assessment\" as a measure type. So it's likely considered a measure. Is it a biomarker? It's a caregiver reaction assessment subscale, which is a proxy measure of caregiver burden, not a direct biomarker. The question: \"determine if it is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents.\" The documents show it as a measure used in studies, but is it a marker? The context says \"Role Captivity Sub-scale of Caregiver Reaction Assessment\" is a measure. But is it a marker? The instruction: \"Your task is to analyze a list of potential markers extracted from datasets and validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" For each element, determine if the element is actually a recognized marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's. So we need to decide if RC-CRA qualifies as a recognized marker. The context shows it as a measure used in studies, but it's a caregiver reaction assessment, not a biomarker. The question might consider it a marker because it's used as an outcome measure. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". Usually biomarkers are biological measures. RC-CRA is not a biomarker. So likely invalid.\n\nBut let's examine the context: The table lists many measures, including \"RC-CRA: Role Captivity Sub-scale of Caregiver Reaction Assessment\" maybe earlier. Actually, the snippet \"Context for RC-CRA: Role Captivity Sub-scale of Caregiver Reaction Assessment: stionnaire ObsRO 4 1 Attentive Matrices (AM)\" suggests that RC-CRA is a measure. But the table continues with other measures. The table has columns: Measure name, Type of COAa, Disease severity, Total frequency, Preclinical AD, MCI, Mild AD, Moderate AD, Severe AD, Other severity/Type not listed. Under that table, we see entries like \"Attentive Matrices (AM)\", \"Alzheimer’s Disease Related Quality of Life (ADRQL)\", etc. There's no explicit row for RC-CRA. But earlier, before the table, there's a heading \"Context for RC-CRA: Role Captivity Sub-scale of Caregiver Reaction Assessment: stionnaire ObsRO 4 1 Attentive Matrices (AM) PerfO 4 1...\". That looks like a formatting glitch where RC-CRA is being described as a measure. But the actual table may not contain RC-CRA. However, the presence of RC-CRA in the context indicates it's a measure used in studies. But is it a recognized marker? The instruction says \"validate them using the provided scientific literature.\" The literature includes the table and references to ADAS-Cog. The table includes many measures, but none are called \"markers\" per se. But the user wants to know if each element is a recognized marker for Alzheimer's according to the documents. So we need to interpret whether RC-CRA is a recognized marker. The table includes \"RC-CRA: Role Captivity Sub-scale of Caregiver Reaction Assessment\" as a measure. But the table's column \"Type of COAa\" might indicate the type of measure: \"ObsRO\" stands for Observed Response Outcome? Actually, \"ObsRO\" means Observer-reported outcome. So RC-CRA is an observer-reported outcome. But is it a marker? The term \"marker\" could be loosely applied to any outcome measure. But the instruction says \"marker/biomarker for Alzheimer's\". Biomarkers are usually biological. But the user might consider any measure as a marker. But the instruction says \"the marker must be documented in scientific literature as correlated with Alzheimer's.\" The RC-CRA is a caregiver reaction assessment, not directly correlated with Alzheimer's pathology. But it might correlate with disease severity. But is it documented as a marker? The context doesn't provide evidence linking RC-CRA to Alzheimer's. It just lists it as a measure used in studies. So I'd say it's not a recognized marker.\n\nNow for ADAS-Cog11: The context clearly states ADAS-Cog-11 is a widely used cognitive outcome measure in AD clinical trials. It is definitely a recognized marker for Alzheimer's. The acronym is ADAS-Cog-11. The abbreviation given is \"ADAS-Cog-11\". The user wrote \"ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale‑11‑item Cognitive Subscale\". The acronym is ADAS-Cog-11. So we can set valid=true, acronym=\"ADAS-Cog-11\".\n\nThus output JSON array with two objects:\n\nFirst object: original_name: 'RC-CRA: Role Captivity Sub-scale of Caregiver Reaction Assessment', valid:false, acronym:\"N/A\"\n\nSecond object: original_name: \"ADAS-Cog11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale‑11‑item Cognitive Subscale\", valid:true, acronym:\"ADAS-Cog-11\"\n\nMake sure to follow required JSON format exactly: Each object with keys \"original_name\",\"valid\",\"acronym\". Output as a JSON array? The instruction says \"For each element, use this JSON structure: {... }\". It didn't specify array, but typical would be array. We'll produce an array of objects.\n\nAlso ensure no extra keys. Use double quotes. Ensure boolean values without quotes. Acronym string. For invalid, acronym \"N/A\".\n\nLet's craft final answer.",
