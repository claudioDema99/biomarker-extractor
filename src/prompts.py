A typical reference range is 6-23 micrograms/deciliter (mcg/dL) from blood drawn in the morning. Low levels of cortisol can indicate Addison's disease or a problem with the pituitary gland, while high levels may indicate tumors of the adrenal gland, among other illnesses, or increased stress. Chronic elevation of cortisol is associated with reduced immune function and increased risk of heart disease. IL-2 treatment stimulates the release of cortisol and this stimulation is dose dependent (rising as the dose of IL-2 increases) and tends to increase further with repeated exposure to IL-2. Blood was drawn for measuring cortisol at screening (baseline value) and once during days 1-3 of each cycle of the four IL-2 treatments.;/nThe mean number of IL-2 doses tolerated (out of the possible 60 total doses) are presented for each study arm. The standard high dose regimen of IL-2 includes 15 doses per cycle. The dose of IL-2 is reduced, or treatment is stopped entirely, if the side effects become severe. This analysis includes the total number of doses taken at the end of Cycle 4, by all participants who began the trial, regardless of how many cycles each participant completed.;/nHamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) is a 21-item, observer-rated scale which quantifies the severity of depressive symptoms, including depressed mood, loss of interest in usually pleasurable activities, insomnia, anorexia, fatigue, weight loss, and psychomotor retardation or agitation. Participants rate the severity of their symptoms on a scale of 0-2 or 0-4 (depending on the item), where 0 means that the symptom is absent. Total scores are calculated by summing the first 17 items for a total score between 0 and 50. For this study a score of 0-6 indicates a normal state, a score of 7-17 indicates mild depression, a score of 18-24 indicates moderate depression, and a score of greater than 25 indicates severe depression. The HAM-D was administered at screening (baseline value) and once during days 1-3 of each cycle of the four IL-2 treatments.;/nAdrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is a stress hormone that is synthesized by the pituitary in response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). ACTH stimulates adrenal cortisol production. ACTH levels vary throughout the day and are highest between 6am and 8am. A typical reference range is 10-50 picograms per milliliter (pg/ml) from blood drawn in the morning. Low levels of ACTH can indicate adrenal insufficiency (including adrenal cancers) while high levels may indicate several diseases or stress. IL-2 treatment stimulates the release of ACTH and this stimulation is dose dependent (rising as the dose of IL-2 increases) and tends to increase further with repeated exposure to IL-2. Blood was drawn for measuring ACTH at screening (baseline value) and once during days 1-3 of each cycle of the four IL-2 treatments.;/nImmune system functioning was assessed by measuring plasma concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6).

The scale measures objective and subjective effects such as restlessness and awareness of restlessness, respectively. Participants are observed while seated, then while standing and engaged in neutral conversation. Symptoms observed during additional situations, such as participant behavior on the ward, may also be rated. Subjective phenomena should be elicited through direct questioning of the participant.

The AIMS is a scale that aids in the early detection and ongoing monitoring of tardive dyskinesia, a movement disorder that can result from long-term treatment with antipsychotic medication. By assessing the participant's body movement in specific positions requiring rotation, a psychiatrist is able to determine whether abnormal facial or body movements exist./nThe total score is the sum of 7 questions assessing movement plus 3 questions representing global assessments on the overall level of involuntary movement severity, incapacitation due to involuntary movement, and patient's awareness of involuntary movement. Each of the 10 questions are scored on a 0 (none) - 4 (extremely severe) scale. Plus two dental status questions are scored on a 0 (no) - 1 (yes) scale. The total score is therefore a scale of 0 (normal) - 42 (advanced tardive dyskinesia).;/nAUCtau calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule./nThe switch from oral risperidone to RBP-7000 subcutaneous injections for safety markers used SAS. The SAS is a 10-item scale used to detect the presence of drug induced parkinsonism and extrapyramidal side effects, and evaluates symptom severity. The ten items focus on rigidity rather than bradykinesia, and do not assess subjective rigidity or slowness. Items are rated for severity on a 0 to 4 scale with 0=normal and 4=extreme description of the particular side effect. The total range is 0=no side effects observed to 40 = extreme of each of the 10 side effects.;/nThe average of plasma concentrations calculated as AUCtau/ tau (tau = 28 days)/nAn adverse event (AE) is defined as any study-related event that represents a change (positive or negative) in frequency or severity from a baseline (prestudy) event (if any), regardless of the presence of causal relationship or medical significance. Treatment-emergent adverse events are defined as any adverse event with a start date on or after the first study dose date. AEs are determined by the Investigator to be related or not related to the study drug./nA serious AE (SAE) is defined by federal regulation as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

The main surrogate markers used are: the Maximum Concentration (Cmax) that is the highest amount of drug in the blood after a dose; The Minimum Concentration (Cmin) that is the lowest amount of drug in the blood between doses. The Average Concentration (Cavg) that is the average drug level over a 28-day period. Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) that is how long it takes for the drug to reach its peak concentration. Area Under the Curve (AUC) the total amount of drug exposure over a specific period. Accumulation Index (Rac) that is how much the drug levels build up in the body after multiple doses. It's calculated by comparing the AUC and Cmax of the third injection to the first where a value greater than 1 indicates drug accumulation. Fluctuation and Swing are markers to measure the stability of drug levels, showing the difference between the maximum and minimum concentrations. To characterize the efficacy of the RBP-7000 multiple psychitric markers are adopted, such as: the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) that measures the severity of symptoms (i.e.: hallucinations and emotional withdrawal) and the Clinical Global Impression scales - clinically administrered by physicains - that provide an overall assessment of a patient's illness severity (CGI-S) and change (CGI-C). This record also reports for potential side effects, a critical part of any drug study, proposing different markers such as: the Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) to document any health problems that occurred after the treatment begins; Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) to monitor for tardive dyskinesia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive body movements; Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) to assess for drug-induced Parkinsonism symptoms like rigidity and tremors; Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) to asseess for akathisia, a feeling of inner restlessness; the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) to systematically track any suicidal thoughts or behaviors.', 'biomarkers':['Cmax:  Maximum Concentration','Cmin: Minimum Concentration','Cavg: Average Concentration','Tmax: Time to Maximum Concentration','AUC: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve','Rac: Accumulation Index','Fluctuation: (Cmax-Cmin)/Cavg','Swing: (Cmax-Cmin)/Cmin','PANSS: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale','CGI-S: Clinical Global Impression of Severity','CGI-C: Clinical Global Impression of Change','AIMS: Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale','SAS: Simpson-Angus Scale','BAS: Barnes Akathisia Scale','C-SSRS: Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale','TEAEs: Number of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events']}\n5.
