BIOMARKER DEFINITION: A biomarker is a quantifiable characteristic of the body that serves as an objective indicator of biological processes or pathological conditions in Alzheimer's disease.

MAIN ALZHEIMER'S BIOMARKERS (examples): Beta-amyloid (CSF, PET), Tau/p-Tau (CSF), Brain volumes (MRI), Cognitive tests (MMSE, ADAS-Cog), Genetic markers (APOE).

MANDATORY OUTPUT RULES (must be followed exactly):
1. Output **exactly one** JSON object and nothing else (no surrounding text, no code fences). The JSON must have two keys:
   {"analysis": "<4-5 concise sentences>", "biomarkers": [list of biomarker with required syntax]}
2. "analysis" must be a single string of 4â€“5 sentences that reference the evidence in the records.
3. "biomarkers" must be a JSON array. Each element in the array MUST follow this exact syntax:
   "ACRONYM/NAME: expanded form of the acronym (or a brief description of the biomarker if not acronym)"
   Examples:
   - "MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination"
   - "APOE4: Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele"
   - "Beta-amyloid (CSF): Cerebrospinal fluid levels of beta-amyloid"
4. Collapse duplicates (each biomarker appears once).
5. If you cannot follow these rules, output exactly:
   {"analysis":"", "biomarkers":[]}
Always reason with clinical rigor and refer only to evidence in the records.
