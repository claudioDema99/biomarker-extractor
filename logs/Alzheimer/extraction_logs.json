They didn't include liver enzymes. So likely we focus on AD-related markers. So exclude routine labs.\n\n- Heart rate: HR. Not AD-specific.\n\n- BP: SBP, DBP.

But we may want to differentiate group-specific? The example didn't differentiate. In earlier examples, they had ADCS-ADL etc. They didn't differentiate by group.

Let's parse.\n\nMarkers:\n\n- HbA1c: Hemoglobin A1c levels. Acronym: HbA1c: Hemoglobin A1c\n- CIBIC+: Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus? It's a rating scale. Use CIBIC+: Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus\n- Clinical chemistry parameters: many labs. But we need markers like ALT, AST, ALP, BUN, Creatinine, GGT, HDL, LDL, etc. They are markers. Should list each? The instruction says markers are quantitative criteria and features. So each lab parameter qualifies. Provide acronym: ALT: Alanine Aminotransferase; AST: Aspartate Aminotransferase; ALP: Alkaline Phosphatase; BUN: Blood Urea Nitrogen; Cr: Creatinine; GGT: Gamma Glutamyl Transferase; HDL: High Density Lipoprotein; LDL: Low Density Lipoprotein; LDH: Lactate Dehydrogenase; Mg: Magnesium; K: Potassium; P: Phosphorus; Na: Sodium; TP: Total Protein; TC: Total Cholesterol; TBIL: Total Bilirubin; TG: Triglycerides; CPK: Creatine Phosphokinase; CO2: Carbon Dioxide; Ca: Calcium; Cl: Chloride; RBC: Red Blood Cell count; HGB: Hemoglobin; HCT: Hematocrit; WBC: White Blood Cell count; Neutrophils; Lymphocytes; Monocytes; Eosinophils; Basophils; MCV; MCH; MCHC; RDW; Platelet; Mean Platelet Volume maybe not reported. We'll include those listed.\n\n- DAD: Disability Assessment for Dementia? Actually DAD scale. Use DAD: Disability Assessment for Dementia\n- ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale. Use ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale\n- Short term memory assessment score from ADAS-Cog items 1 & 7. Could treat as Memory Recall Score? Might just be part of ADAS-Cog. Not separate marker.\n\n- MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination. Use MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination\n- Body weight: Weight measurement. Use BW: Body Weight\n- EQ-5D Proxy: EuroQol 5 Dimensions Proxy. Use EQ-5D Proxy: EuroQol 5-Dimensions Proxy\n- ACQLI: Acquaintance? Actually ACQLI: Acquaintance? Wait ACQLI stands for \"Acquaintance Quality of Life Index\"? In context it's caregiver quality of life index. Use ACQLI: Acquaintance Caregiver Quality of Life Index? Might be \"Acquaintance Caregiver Quality of Life Index\". We'll write ACQLI: Acquaintance Caregiver Quality of Life Index\n- RUD: Resource Utilization in Dementia. Use RUD: Resource Utilization in Dementia\n- SBP, DBP, HR: Systolic BP, Diastolic BP, Heart Rate. Use SBP: Systolic Blood Pressure; DBP: Diastolic Blood Pressure; HR: Heart Rate\n- ECG parameters: PR interval, QRS duration, QT, QTc Bazett, QTc Fridericia, RR interval. Use PR: PR Interval; QRS: QRS Duration; QT: QT Interval; QTcB: QTc Bazett; QTcF: QTc Fridericia; RR: RR Interval\n- AE: Adverse Event. Use AE: Adverse Event\n- SAE: Serious Adverse Event? Not mentioned but AE includes. We'll keep AE.\n\n- NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory.

For subdomains, maybe use \"SOCIAL COMMUNICATION: Social Communication subscore\"? But acronym missing. Maybe use \"SCOM: Social Communication subscore\". But not in text. Better to just list main instruments. The example didn't list subdomains unless explicitly named. In example 4, they listed ADAS-cog subcategories as separate markers?

These are markers? They are imaging findings. We can treat as markers like \"Brain Edema\", \"Hemorrhage\", etc. But we need to list markers with acronym: maybe \"MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging\" but only if a marker extracted from MRI is present. So we could list each abnormality as separate markers. However guidelines: \"include techniques or modalities, but only if a marker extracted from these techniques is explicitly present\". So we can list each abnormality as marker. Use acronym? For example \"Edema: Brain Edema\". But there is no acronym. Could use \"EDEMA\"? Not needed. Just use the term. Format requires \"ACRONYM: expanded form\". If no acronym, create logical abbreviation or use shortest recognizable form. So we might use \"ED: Brain Edema\". But maybe simpler: \"Brain Edema: Brain Edema\". But that's redundant. Maybe use \"BE: Brain Edema\".

Perhaps we can use \"TOPS: Topical Outcome Profile System\" but it's okay? The instruction: \"If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form.\" So we can create abbreviation. So TOPS: Topical Outcome Profile System?

But maybe we should list each symptom as separate marker? The example lists each scale separately. So we could list \"TOPS Mood Symptom Category\", \"TOPS Repetitiveness Symptom Category\", etc. But the requirement: markers are quantitative criteria and features.

    "cot": "We need to parse the record and identify markers explicitly present. Markers include clinical scales, lab parameters, imaging etc. Must list unique markers with acronym: expanded form. Use uppercase acronym before colon. For lab parameters, we may treat each parameter as marker? In previous examples, they listed individual lab analytes like hemoglobin, etc. They did list many lab parameters. So we should list each lab parameter as separate marker. Also vital signs: pulse rate, blood pressure. But those are measurements, not markers? Could consider \"Pulse Rate\" and \"Blood Pressure\". But earlier examples didn't list vital signs as markers unless specifically used as endpoints. Here they mention vital signs assessment included pulse rate and blood pressure. Might include \"PR: Pulse Rate\" and \"BP: Blood Pressure\"? But guidelines: markers are quantitative criteria and features used to diagnose or evaluate AD. Vital signs are safety markers. Should include them. Also ADA assay positivity, NAb assay positivity. Those are immunogenicity markers. Include \"ADA: Anti-Drug Antibody\" and \"NAb: Neutralizing Antibodies\".\n\nAlso DAD: Disability Assessment for Dementia? Actually DAD stands for Disability Assessment for Dementia. Provide \"DAD: Disability Assessment for Dementia\". NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory. MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination. ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale.

That's many markers.\n\nAlso ECG parameters: PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, QTcF. These are markers.\n\nC-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Provide \"C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\".\n\nAlso DAD, NPI, MMSE, ADAS-Cog, CDR, CDR-SB.\n\nAlso \"ADA assay\" and \"Neutralizing anti-drug antibody assay\" markers.\n\nAlso \"Brain MRI\" as imaging marker.\n\nAlso \"Vital signs\" includes pulse rate and blood pressure. We could list \"Pulse Rate\" and \"Blood Pressure\" as markers.\n\nAlso \"Laboratory parameters\" include many. We'll list each.\n\nNeed to collapse duplicates. Ensure each marker appears once.\n\nNow produce analysis: 4-5 sentences referencing evidence.\n\nLet's craft analysis:\n\n\"The record lists several safety and efficacy markers. Safety markers include vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure), ECG intervals (PR, QRS, QTcF), laboratory panels (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, coagulation, immune complexes, complement), and immunogenicity assays (anti‑drug antibody, neutralizing antibodies). Efficacy markers comprise functional and neuropsychological instruments: DAD, NPI, MMSE, ADAS‑Cog, CDR, CDR‑SB, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Imaging safety marker is brain MRI. All markers are explicitly named in the outcome measurement description.\"\n\nNow markers list. Need to format each as \"ACRONYM: expanded form\". For lab parameters without acronym, we can use the term itself as abbreviation? Eg \"Hemoglobin: Hemoglobin\". But guidelines say if no acronym exists, create logical abbreviation or use shortest recognizable form. For each lab parameter, we can use the term itself capitalized as abbreviation. Eg \"Hb: Hemoglobin\". But Hb is common abbreviation. Let's use \"Hb: Hemoglobin\". Similarly \"Hct: Hematocrit\". RBC count: \"RBC Count: Red Blood Cell Count\". RBC morphology: \"RBC Morphology: Red Blood Cell Morphology\". Platelet count: \"PLT Count: Platelet Count\". WBC count: \"WBC Count: White Blood Cell Count\". Neutrophils: \"Neutrophils: Neutrophil Count\". Eosinophils: \"Eosinophils: Eosinophil Count\". Monocytes: \"Monocytes: Monocyte Count\". Basophils: \"Basophils: Basophil Count\". Lymphocytes: \"Lymphocytes: Lymphocyte Count\". BUN: \"BUN: Blood Urea Nitrogen\". Creatinine: \"Creatinine: Serum Creatinine\". Glucose: \"Glucose: Serum Glucose\". Calcium: \"Calcium: Serum Calcium\". Sodium: \"Sodium: Serum Sodium\". Potassium: \"Potassium: Serum Potassium\". Chloride: \"Chloride: Serum Chloride\". Bicarbonate: \"Bicarbonate: Serum Bicarbonate\". AST: \"AST: Aspartate Aminotransferase\". ALT: \"ALT: Alanine Aminotransferase\". Bilirubin: \"Bilirubin: Total Bilirubin\". ALP: \"ALP: Alkaline Phosphatase\". Uric Acid: \"UA: Uric Acid\". Albumin: \"Albumin: Serum Albumin\". Total Protein: \"TP: Total Protein\". Urinalysis pH: \"Urine pH: Urine pH\". Urine glucose: \"Urine Glucose: Urine Glucose\". Urine protein: \"Urine Protein: Urine Protein\". Urine blood: \"Urine Blood: Urine Blood\". Urine ketones: \"Urine Ketones: Urine Ketones\". Urine nitrites: \"Urine Nitrites: Urine Nitrites\". Urine leukocyte esterase: \"Urine LE: Urine Leukocyte Esterase\". Urine microscopy: \"Urine Microscopy: Urine Microscopy\". Coagulation panel: \"Coag Panel: Coagulation Panel\". Circulating immune complex: \"Circulating IC: Circulating Immune Complex\". Complement activation: \"Complement Activation: Complement Activation\".\n\nBut that's huge. Maybe too many. However example 5 had many markers. So okay.\n\nAlso vital signs: \"Pulse Rate: Pulse Rate\". \"Blood Pressure: Blood Pressure\". For blood pressure we might specify \"SBP: Systolic Blood Pressure\" and \"DBP: Diastolic Blood Pressure\". But they mention SBP and DBP. So include \"SBP: Systolic Blood Pressure\" and \"DBP: Diastolic Blood Pressure\".\n\nECG: \"PR Interval: PR Interval\". \"QRS Interval: QRS Interval\". \"QT Interval: QT Interval\". \"QTcF: Corrected QT Interval (Fridericia)\".\n\nImmunogenicity: \"ADA: Anti‑Drug Antibody\". \"NAb: Neutralizing Antibody\".\n\nFunctional: \"DAD: Disability Assessment for Dementia\". \"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\". \"MMSE: Mini‑Mental State Examination\". \"ADAS-Cog: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale\". \"CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating\". \"CDR-SB: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes\". \"C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\".\n\nImaging: \"MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging\".\n\nAlso \"Brain MRI\" maybe just \"MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging\".\n\nNow compile list sorted alphabetically?

We should include markers that are explicitly present: ARIA-E, ARIA-H, MBs, ATA, CTCAE v4.0, maybe \"superficial siderosis\" as a marker? It's a condition. But it's part of ARIA-H definition. The instruction: \"extract ONLY markers explicitly present in the text.\" So we list markers like \"ARIA-E: Symptomatic and asymptomatic Alzheimer’s Related Imaging Abnormalities – Edema\", \"ARIA-H: Cerebral micro-hemorrhages and superficial siderosis\", \"Microbleeds (MBs): Radiologically defined small dot-like foci on MRI\", \"ATA: Anti-drug antibody against crenezumab\", \"CTCAE v4.0: Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale\".\n\nAlso \"AE severity grading scale\" could be considered a marker. We'll include \"CTCAE v4.0: Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale\". Also \"SAE: Serious Adverse Event\" but that's a definition. Maybe not a marker. The markers are quantitative criteria and features used to diagnose or evaluate AD. So CTCAE is a grading scale for adverse events, not specifically AD. But still a marker of safety. We'll include.\n\nThus markers list:\n\n\"ARIA-E: Alzheimer’s Related Imaging Abnormalities – Edema\"\n\"ARIA-H: Alzheimer’s Related Imaging Abnormalities – Hemorrhage/Siderosis\"\n\"MBs: Cerebral micro-hemorrhages detected on MRI\"\n\"ATA: Anti-drug Antibody against crenezumab\"\n\"CTCAE v4.0: Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale\"\n\nCheck duplicates: none.\n\nNow produce JSON with analysis 4-5 sentences referencing evidence.

We must list unique markers with acronym: expanded form. Use uppercase acronym.

But it's part of NPI. Should we list separate? The instruction says markers are quantitative criteria and features. So each distinct metric: EQ-5D utility score, EQ-5D VAS, MMSE total score, ADAS-cog total score, ADCS-ADL23 total score, ADCS-CGIC total score, NPI total score, NPI anxiety item score, single NPI item scores. Also mention clinical response/worsening definitions but those are derived from other markers. So markers list:\n\n- EQ-5D Utility Score\n- EQ-5D VAS\n- MMSE: Mini Mental State Examination\n- ADAS-cog: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale\n- ADCS-ADL23: Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living Inventory (23-item)\n- ADCS-CGIC: Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Clinical Global Impression of Change\n- NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\n- NPI Anxiety Item Score\n- Single NPI Item Score\n\nAlso maybe \"clinical response\" and \"clinical worsening\" are not markers themselves but derived categories. Not needed.\n\nThus produce JSON with analysis sentence referencing evidence. Must be 4-5 sentences. Provide markers array with each entry formatted \"ACRONYM: expanded\". For ones without acronym like EQ-5D, we still use acronym. For \"EQ-5D VAS\" maybe acronym \"EQ-5D VAS\"? We'll use \"EQ-5D VAS: EuroQol 5-Dimensional Visual Analogue Scale\".\n\nFor \"Single NPI Item Score\" maybe acronym \"NPI Single Item\". Use \"NPI SI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory Single Item Score\".\n\nBut guidelines: always use acronym uppercase before colon. If no acronym exists, create logical abbreviation or use shortest recognizable form. So for \"EQ-5D Utility Score\" we could use \"EQ-5D US: EuroQol 5-Dimensional Utility Score\". But maybe simpler: \"EQ-5D: EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health Questionnaire\" but that's the instrument itself. However the marker is the utility score. Might just use \"EQ-5D: EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health Questionnaire\" though that refers to instrument. Acceptable? In examples, they used \"ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Score\". So they used instrument name. So we can do similar: \"EQ-5D: EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health Questionnaire\". That covers both utility and VAS? They had separate entries for \"EQ-5D VAS\" maybe not necessary. But we can list \"EQ-5D VAS: EuroQol 5-Dimensional Visual Analogue Scale\". Good.\n\nSimilarly \"MMSE: Mini Mental State Examination\". \"ADAS-cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale\". \"ADCS-ADL23: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living Inventory (23-item)\". \"ADCS-CGIC: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study – Clinical Global Impression of Change\". \"NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\". \"NPI Anxiety Item: Neuropsychiatric Inventory Anxiety Item\". \"NPI Single Item: Neuropsychiatric Inventory Single Item Score\".\n\nLet's craft markers array accordingly.\n\nNow analysis: 4-5 sentences referencing evidence.

It's called DEMQOL-Proxy. We can use DEMQOL-Proxy: DEMQOL-Proxy Questionnaire (Health-related Quality of Life).\n\n- CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating scale. Also CSR-SB? Actually sum of boxes is called CSR-SB? Wait text says \"sum of box score (CSR-SB)\" maybe typo. But we can include CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. And CSR-SB: Sum of Box Score? Might treat as separate marker: CSR-SB: Sum of Box Score (CDR). But acronym CSR-SB not common. Could just include CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale.\n\n- ADAS-cog: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive subscale. Marker: ADAS-cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale.\n\n- ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living. Marker: ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living.\n\n- Percent of Total Hippocampus Atrophy to Intracranial Volume: metric. Acronym? Maybe THA: Total Hippocampus Atrophy? Not given. We'll use THA: Total Hippocampus Atrophy to Intracranial Volume ratio.\n\n- COWAT: Controlled Oral Word Association Test. Marker: COWAT: Controlled Oral Word Association Test.\n\n- MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination. Marker: MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination.\n\n- SUVR PET: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio PET. Marker: SUVR PET: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio Positron Emission Tomography.\n\nAlso mention 3DT1 MRI used for segmentation but not a marker itself. But could include 3DT1 MRI: T1-weighted structural MRI. However it's a modality, not a marker unless used to compute SUVR. But guidelines say include technique only if marker extracted from it is present. Here SUVR is extracted from PET, so we don't need MRI alone.\n\nAlso \"brain hypometabolism\" measured by SUVR PET. Already captured.\n\nThus markers list: NPI, DEMQOL-Proxy, CDR, ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, THA, COWAT, MMSE, SUVR PET.\n\nCheck duplicates: none.\n\nNow craft analysis: 4-5 sentences referencing evidence.

They include various scales and measures. Must use acronym first then colon. For each marker we need to provide \"ACRONYM: expanded form\". Use uppercase acronym. If no acronym, create logical abbreviation or use shortest recognizable form. But we should avoid invented ones. Let's list:\n\n- Time to complete 5 chair stands without using arms in seconds. That's part of SPPB? It's a measurement but not named. Could call \"Chair Stand Time\". But maybe it's part of SPPB. However the record lists it separately earlier: \"Time to complete 5 chair stands without using arms in seconds.\" That is a marker. Should we give acronym? Maybe \"ChairStandTime\" but no acronym. We could use \"ChairStandTime: Time to complete 5 chair stands without using arms in seconds\". But guidelines say use acronym if available. None. So we can use \"ChairStandTime: Time to complete 5 chair stands without using arms in seconds\".\n\nBut there might be duplication: later SPPB uses same measure. But we collapse duplicates. So we keep one entry.\n\n- QOL-AD: Quality of Life Scale in Alzheimer's Disease. Provide expansion.\n\n- ADAS-cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale.\n\n- Falls efficacy measure: maybe \"FallsEfficacyScale\"? Not acronym. We'll use \"FallsEfficacyScale: Standard measure of falls efficacy asking about concern about falling\".\n\n- GDS-short form: Geriatric Depression Scale short form. Acronym GDS.\n\n- Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) components: side-by-side, semi-tandem, tandem balance. Also \"better of two times in seconds\" maybe part of SPPB. But we already have SPPB. Might list SPPB: Short Physical Performance Battery.\n\n- Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD).\n\n- Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Frequency*Severity subscale (NPI-FS). Acronym NPI-FS.\n\n- Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Acronym NPI.\n\n- Positive aspects of caregiving scale: maybe \"PositiveCaregivingScale\" but no acronym. We'll name \"PositiveCaregivingScale: Standard measure rating agreement/disagreement with 11 statements about positive aspects of caregiving\".\n\n- Caregiver assessment of participant's quality of life: maybe \"CaregiverQoL\" but no acronym. We'll use \"CaregiverQoL: Caregiver assessment of participant's quality of life\".\n\n- SPPB: Short Physical Performance Battery again. Already listed.\n\n- Caregiver Distress measure: maybe \"CaregiverDistressScale\" but no acronym. We'll use \"CaregiverDistressScale: Measure of caregiver distress associated with 12 common dementia-related behaviors\".\n\n- Satisfaction survey: maybe \"CaregiverSatisfactionSurvey\" but no acronym. We'll use \"CaregiverSatisfactionSurvey: Anonymous satisfaction survey after completion or withdrawal\".\n\n- Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI). Acronym CBI.\n\nAlso \"Flexibility measure\" and \"Mobility measure\" but those are part of SPPB. But we can list them individually? They are separate measures: \"Flexibility measure\" and \"Mobility measure\". But they are not named. Might skip because not explicit marker names. But they are measurements. The instruction says markers are quantitative criteria and features. So we can include them. But we need to decide acronym. Could use \"FlexibilityMeasure\" and \"MobilityMeasure\". But maybe better to include them under SPPB. But they are distinct. I'll include them as separate markers.\n\nAlso \"Measure of flexibility in which participant reaches toward toes with a straight leg. Score reflect closest to touching, with positive values reflecting past toes and negative values reflecting not touching toes.\" That's a marker. We'll call \"ToeReachFlexibility: Measure of flexibility reaching toward toes\".\n\nSimilarly \"Measure of mobility in which participant is timed while standing up from a seated position, walking around a cone that is 8 feet away, and returning to a seated position.\" We'll call \"ConeWalkMobility: Measure of mobility timed around a cone\".\n\nBut these are part of SPPB? Actually SPPB includes chair stand, balance, gait speed. These are separate. But we can still list them.\n\nHowever we must avoid duplicates. There is \"Time to complete 5 chair stands\" repeated. Keep one.\n\nNow compile list.\n\nLet's craft analysis sentence: 4-5 sentences referencing evidence.\n\nOk.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nMake sure markers array sorted? Not necessary.\n\nLet's list markers:\n\n- ChairStandTime: Time to complete 5 chair stands without using arms in seconds\n- QOL-AD: Quality of Life Scale in Alzheimer's Disease\n- ADAS-cog: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale\n- FallsEfficacyScale: Standard measure of falls efficacy asking about concern about falling\n- GDS: Geriatric Depression Scale short form\n- SPPB: Short Physical Performance Battery\n- DAD: Disability Assessment for Dementia\n- NPI-FS: Neuropsychiatric Inventory – Frequency*Severity subscale\n- NPI: Neuropsychiatric Inventory\n- PositiveCaregivingScale: Standard measure rating agreement/disagreement with 11 statements about positive aspects of caregiving\n- CaregiverQoL: Caregiver assessment of participant's quality of life\n- CaregiverDistressScale: Measure of caregiver distress associated with 12 common dementia-related behaviors\n- CaregiverSatisfactionSurvey: Anonymous satisfaction survey after completion or withdrawal\n- CBI: Caregiver Burden Inventory\n- ToeReachFlexibility: Measure of flexibility reaching toward toes\n- ConeWalkMobility: Measure of mobility timed around a cone\n\nCheck duplicates: SPPB appears twice but we keep one.\n\nAlso \"Short Physical Performance Battery\" appears earlier as part of SPPB.

Expanded: \"EuroQol Five Dimensions\".\nBut maybe \"EQ-5D\" stands for EuroQoL 5-Dimensions. We'll write \"EQ-5D: EuroQol Five Dimensions Health Status Measure\".\n\n- ADAS-Cog-13: acronym ADAS-Cog-13. Expand: \"Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale 13-item\".\n\n- MMSE: \"Mini-Mental State Examination\".\n\n- Plasma Abeta 42 concentrations: marker \"Plasma Abeta 42\". Not acronym. We could use \"ABETA42-P: Plasma Amyloid-beta 42\". But guidelines: if no acronym, create logical abbreviation or use shortest recognizable form.

So marker \"AE: Adverse Event\".\n\n- ADCS-ADL: \"Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living\". Acronym ADCS-ADL.\n\n- ADA: \"Antidrug Antibody\"? In context \"ADA\" refers to antidrug antibodies. So marker \"ADA: Antidrug Antibody\".\n\n- CDR-GS: \"Clinical Dementia Rating – Global Summary\"? Actually CDR-GS is \"Clinical Dementia Rating – Global Summary\". Use that.\n\n- ZCI-AD: \"Zarit Caregiver Interview – Alzheimer’s Disease\"? It's a modified Zarit Burden Interview.

It's described as rater-administered ObsRO measuring functional ability. So marker: FAQ: Functional Assessment Questionnaire (or maybe \"Functional Assessment Questionnaire\").\n\nNext: ARIA – Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Mentioned as risk with anti-amyloid antibodies, identified on brain MRI. So marker: ARIA: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities. Also ARIA-E and ARIA-H. But we can just list ARIA: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities. Maybe separate ARIA-E: Edema/Effusion; ARIA-H: Hemosiderosis. But guidelines say include technique if marker extracted. Here ARIA itself is a marker. We'll include ARIA: Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities.\n\nAlso mention brain MRI as technique but no explicit metric. So skip.\n\nNext: Change in tau load measured by PET scan with [18F]GTP1 radioligand, SUVR in 4 composite target ROIs. So marker: Tau-PET SUVR: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio of tau PET. Could name \"Tau-PET SUVR\". Also mention composite target ROIs: Temporal composite, Medial temporal, Frontal, Parietal. But those are regions, not markers. So include \"Tau-PET SUVR\".\n\nNext: C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Marker: C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale.\n\nNext: DSST: Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Marker: DSST: Digit Symbol Substitution Test.\n\nNext: CSF phospho-tau, CSF tTau. Markers: CSF pTau: Cerebrospinal Fluid phosphorylated tau; CSF tTau: Cerebrospinal Fluid total tau.\n\nNext: ADAS-Cog13 and ADAS-Cog11. Markers: ADAS-Cog13: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13-item; ADAS-Cog11: same 11-item.\n\nNext: Brain amyloid load measured by [18F] florbetaben or flutemetamol PET, SUVR mapped to centiloid scale. Marker: Amyloid PET SUVR Centiloid: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio of amyloid PET mapped to centiloid scale. Might call \"Amyloid PET Centiloid\". Also mention composite ROI. So marker: Amyloid PET Centiloid.\n\nNext: ADCS-iADL: ADCS Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Marker: ADCS-iADL: ADCS Instrumental Activities of Daily Living.\n\nNext: AE: Adverse Event. But AE is generic. Should we include? It's a marker of safety. They mention AE definitions. Probably yes: AE: Adverse Event.\n\nAlso mention local injection reactions as AE subtype. But AE is marker.\n\nNext: VFT: Verbal Fluency Task. Marker: VFT: Verbal Fluency Task.\n\nNext: MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination. Marker: MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination.\n\nNext: ADCS-ADL: ADCS Activities of Daily Living. Marker: ADCS-ADL: ADCS Activities of Daily Living.\n\nNext: NFL: Neurofilament Light chain.

    "cot": "We need to parse the record. It says:\n\n\"Percent of subjects who complete the sequence of the fMRI protocol. Range: 0-100. Higher percentage indicates more completion.\"\n\nSo marker: Percent of subjects who complete the sequence of the fMRI protocol. That's a marker. Acronym? fMRI stands for functional magnetic resonance imaging. So we could use fMRI: functional magnetic resonance imaging. But the marker is percent of subjects completing fMRI protocol. We might label as fMRI Completion Rate: Percent of subjects who complete the fMRI protocol. Also second: Percent of subjects whose images were uploaded and analyzed by the Infinitome program. That is a marker: Infinitome Analysis Completion Rate: Percent of subjects whose images were uploaded and analyzed by the Infinitome program. There's no acronym for Infinitome program. Could use INF: Infinitome program. But maybe just \"Infinitome Program Completion Rate\". Use acronym INF? Not sure. The rule: always use acronym uppercase before colon if available. For fMRI it's available. For Infinitome program, no acronym given. We can create a logical abbreviation: INF. But is that allowed? They said \"If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form.\" So we can use INF: Infinitome program. Or maybe \"INF: Infinitome program\". Let's do that.\n\nThus markers array: [\"fMRI: functional magnetic resonance imaging\", \"INF: Infinitome program\"]? Wait we need markers to be the actual markers, not the techniques. The markers are the quantitative criteria/features. So we need to list markers like \"fMRI Completion Rate: Percent of subjects who complete the fMRI protocol\" and \"INF Completion Rate: Percent of subjects whose images were uploaded and analyzed by the Infinitome program\".\n\nBut the format requires \"ACRONYM: expanded form of the acronym (or brief description if no acronym exists)\". So we need to provide the acronym and expanded form. But the example shows they list markers like \"ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Score\". So they use the name of the measurement as the key, then colon and description. In our case, the measurement is \"Percent of subjects who complete the sequence of the fMRI protocol\". We could abbreviate as \"fMRI Completion Rate\". Then colon \"Percent of subjects who complete the fMRI protocol\". Similarly \"Infinitome Program Completion Rate: Percent of subjects whose images were uploaded and analyzed by the Infinitome program\".\n\nBut we need to include acronym before colon. For fMRI Completion Rate, acronym would be fMRI CR? But that's not typical. Maybe we can use \"fMRI-CR: Percent of subjects who complete the fMRI protocol\". But the instruction: \"Use the ACRONYM (in UPPERCASE) before the colon when available. Extract acronyms from text even if they appear in parentheses after full names.\" So fMRI is an acronym. So we can use \"fMRI: Percent of subjects who complete the fMRI protocol\". But that loses the \"Completion Rate\" part. But maybe acceptable. For Infinitome program, no acronym. So we can use \"INF: Infinitome program\". But that doesn't capture the metric. Hmm.\n\nMaybe we should treat the marker itself as \"fMRI Completion Rate\" and use \"fMRI: functional magnetic resonance imaging\" as the expansion. But that seems wrong because the marker is not the technique but the rate. However the examples show they sometimes use the measurement name as the key, e.g., \"ADAS-cog 11: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale\". So we can use \"fMRI Completion Rate: Percent of subjects who complete the fMRI protocol\". And \"Infinitome Program Completion Rate: Percent of subjects whose images were uploaded and analyzed by the Infinitome program\". But we need to include acronym before colon. For first, we can use \"fMRI-CR: Percent of subjects who complete the fMRI protocol\". For second, maybe \"INF-CR: Percent of subjects whose images were uploaded and analyzed by the Infinitome program\". But the instructions say \"If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form.\" So INF-CR is okay.\n\nHowever the examples didn't use hyphens. They used \"ADAS-cog 11\" etc. So we can use \"fMRI-CR\" and \"INF-CR\". Provide expansions accordingly.\n\nLet's craft markers array:\n\n[\"fMRI-CR: Percent of subjects who complete the fMRI protocol\",\n \"INF-CR: Percent of subjects whose images were uploaded and analyzed by the Infinitome program\"]\n\nCheck duplicates: none.\n\nNow analysis sentence: 4-5 sentences referencing evidence.
