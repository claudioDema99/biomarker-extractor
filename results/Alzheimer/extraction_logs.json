Not good.\n\nMaybe we can use \"Pearlin Mastery, Loss, and Competence - Caregiving Competence Subscale Score\" abbreviation \"Pearlin Mastery, Loss, and Competence - Caregiving Competence Subscale Score\". I'm stuck.\n\nLet's look at other examples: They used \"ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Score\". Acronym \"ADCS-ADL\" existed. For scales without acronym, they used \"MMSE Korean Version of CERAD: Mini Mental State Examination\". They used \"MMSE Korean Version of CERAD\" as acronym? Actually they used \"MMSE Korean Version of CERAD\" as key. That is not uppercase acronym but it's the title. So maybe we can just use the full title as key. The rule says \"ALWAYS use the ACRONYM (in UPPERCASE) before the colon when available. Extract acronyms from text even if they appear in parentheses after full names. If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form.\"\n\nThus we can create abbreviations: For Pearlin Mastery, Loss, and Competence - Caregiving Competence Subscale Score, we might use \"Pearlin Mastery, Loss, and Competence - Caregiving Competence Subscale Score\" as \"Pearlin Mastery, Loss, and Competence - Caregiving Competence Subscale Score\". But that's not abbreviation. Maybe \"Pearlin Mastery, Loss, and Competence - Caregiving Competence Subscale Score\" abbreviation \"Pearlin Mastery, Loss, and Competence - Caregiving Competence Subscale Score\". Eh.\n\nAlternatively, we can use \"Pearlin Mastery, Loss, and Competence - Caregiving Competence Subscale Score\" as \"Pearlin Mastery, Loss, and Competence - Caregiving Competence Subscale Score\". It's okay.\n\nBut maybe simpler: Use \"Pearlin Mastery, Loss, and Competence - Caregiving Competence Subscale Score\" as \"Pearlin Mastery, Loss, and Competence - Caregiving Competence Subscale Score\".\n\nOk.\n\nSimilarly for Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) Score -> acronym PSS. So \"PSS: Perceived Stress Scale\".\n\nCenter for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale - Revised (CESD-R) Score -> \"CESD-R: Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale - Revised\".\n\nZarit Burden Inventory (ZBI) Score -> \"ZBI: Zarit Burden Inventory\".\n\nRevised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist (RMBPC) Reaction Score -> \"RMBPC: Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist\".\n\nState-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) State Score -> \"STAI: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory\".\n\nPearlin Mastery, Loss, and Competence - Management of Situation Subscale Score -> maybe \"Pearlin Mastery, Loss, and Competence - Management of Situation Subscale Score\" abbreviation \"Pearlin Mastery, Loss, and Competence - Management of Situation Subscale Score\".\n\nThus biomarkers list will contain 7 entries.\n\nNow analysis: 4-5 sentences referencing evidence.

But TSPO is a protein, but it's part of the measurement. The biomarker is TSPO binding quantified by TV. Should we include TSPO? The instruction says include quantities extracted from techniques, not the technique itself. TSPO is a protein, but the measurement is TV reflecting amount of TSPO. We could include \"TSPO-TV: Total Distribution Volume reflecting TSPO amount\". But the acronym TSPO is not given as a biomarker in the text. The text mentions TSPO. But the biomarker is the TV measurement. So we should list the two biomarkers: \"11C-ER176 SUVr: Standardized Uptake Value Ratio from 11C-ER176 PET\" and \"11C-ER176 TV: Total Distribution Volume from 11C-ER176 PET\".\n\nCheck duplicates: none.\n\nReturn JSON with analysis: 4-5 sentences referencing evidence.

Additionally, several Patient‑Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) subscales and the System Usability Scale capture broader quality‑of‑life and intervention‑acceptability metrics. The SAGE‑LEAF adherence and recommendation indices further extend the set of measurable outcomes.

It's a safety endpoint, not a biomarker. But it's a measurement. Should we include? The guidelines say biomarkers are quantitative criteria and features used to diagnose or evaluate pathology. Safety counts may not be biomarkers. But earlier examples included \"Number of Participants Discontinuing Study Medication Due to an Adverse Event\" maybe not included. In example 1, they didn't include that. So likely exclude non-biomarker endpoints like adverse events counts.
