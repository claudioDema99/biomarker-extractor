Mi servono questo formato di "examples" da fornire ad un LLM per l'analisi ed estrazione di biomarkers da un database enorme.
Guarda l'allegato "esempi.txt" per capire il formato: ogni esempio ha un input formato da due parametri, esattamente "outcome_measurement_title" e "outcome_measurement_description", e da queste informazioni l'LLM dovrtebbe estrarre una breve analisi da inserire nel json nella chiave corrispondente "analysis", e una lista dei biomarcatori identificati nella chiave "biomarkers", rispettando la sintessi "ACRONIMO: expanded form of the acronym".
Prova ad applicare la stessa analisi ed estrazione di biomarker al seguente input record.

Input record:

902231737 - OG000: Proportion of Participants Who Report They Are More Likely to Use a Smart-phone App Over an Activity Tracker to Monitor Their Symptoms;
902231744 - OG000: Average Change From Baseline in Severity of Manic Symptoms, as Measured With the Young Mania Rating Scale;
902231745 - OG001: Average Change From Baseline in Severity of Manic Symptoms, as Measured With the Young Mania Rating Scale;
902231746 - OG000: Average Change From Baseline in Severity of Depressive Symptoms, as Measured With the 17-item Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression;
902231747 - OG001: Average Change From Baseline in Severity of Depressive Symptoms, as Measured With the 17-item Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression;
902231740 - OG000: Average Proportion of Study Days With At Least 12 Hours of Activity Tracking;
902231741 - OG001: Average Proportion of Study Days With At Least 12 Hours of Activity Tracking;
902231742 - OG000: Proportion of Participants Who Have Higher Adherence Rates for Self-reporting Symptoms Than Adherence Rates for Activity Tracking;
902231743 - OG001: Proportion of Participants Who Have Higher Adherence Rates for Self-reporting Symptoms Than Adherence Rates for Activity Tracking
  outcome_measurement_description: 902231738 - OG000: For each individual, adherence rate for self-reporting symptoms is measured/defined as the proportion of study days with at least 50% completion of of daily self-reports questions (i.e. 6 questions completed out of a total of 12).

This measure is the average adherence rate for individuals in each of the two intervention arms: individuals who review their data with an interviewer ('Weekly review' arm) vs those who do not review their data with an interviewer ('No weekly review' arm).;
902231739 - OG001: For each individual, adherence rate for self-reporting symptoms is measured/defined as the proportion of study days with at least 50% completion of of daily self-reports questions (i.e. 6 questions completed out of a total of 12).
902231737 - OG000: Likelihood of using app over activity tracker is measured using a survey designed specifically for this study to evaluate participant engagement in monitoring symptoms. The relevant question asks 'Which are you more likely to use to monitor your symptoms' and has two mutually-exclusive options for an answer: 'An activity tracker' or 'A smart-phone app'. Engagement survey is conducted over the phone by an interviewer.;
902231744 - OG000: The Young Mania Rating Scale consists of clinician-rated 11 items to evaluate symptoms of mania, such as elevated mood, energy, and irritability. Item scores are added together to get a total score, ranging from 0 to 60. A higher score indicates more severe manic symptoms.;
902231745 - OG001: The Young Mania Rating Scale consists of clinician-rated 11 items to evaluate symptoms of mania, such as elevated mood, energy, and irritability. Item scores are added together to get a total score, ranging from 0 to 60. A higher score indicates more severe manic symptoms.;
902231746 - OG000: The 17-Item Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression consists of 17 clinician-rated items to evaluate symptoms of depression, such as guilt, fatigue, and depressed mood. Item scores are summed to get a total score, ranging from 0 to 52. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.;
902231747 - OG001: The 17-Item Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression consists of 17 clinician-rated items to evaluate symptoms of depression, such as guilt, fatigue, and depressed mood. Item scores are summed to get a total score, ranging from 0 to 52. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.;
902231740 - OG000: For each individual, adherence rate for activity tracking is measured as the proportion of study days with at least 12 hours of activity tracking.
This measure is the average adherence rates among individuals in either arm: individuals who review their data weekly with an interviewer ('Weekly review' arm) compared to individuals who do not review their data weekly with an interviewer ('No weekly review' arm);
902231741 - OG001: For each individual, adherence rate for activity tracking is measured as the proportion of study days with at least 12 hours of activity tracking.
902231742 - OG000: For each individual, adherence rate for activity tracking is measured as the proportion of study days with at least 12 hours of activity tracking, whereas adherence rate for self-reporting symptoms is measured as the proportion of study days with at least 50% of daily self-reports survey questions completed.;
902231743 - OG001: For each individual, adherence rate for activity tracking is measured as the proportion of study days with at least 12 hours of activity tracking, whereas adherence rate for self-reporting symptoms is measured as the proportion of study days with at least 50% of daily self-reports survey questions completed.
