These are markers: \"Orthostatic Hypotension\", \"Heart Rate (HR)\", \"Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)\", \"Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)\", \"Weight\". Use abbreviations: \"OH: Orthostatic Hypotension\", \"HR: Heart Rate\", \"SBP: Systolic Blood Pressure\", \"DBP: Diastolic Blood Pressure\", \"WT: Weight\". But we might keep original terms: \"Orthostatic Hypotension\", \"Heart Rate\", \"Blood Pressure\", \"Weight\". However guidelines say use acronym uppercase before colon if available. For BP there is no acronym given. Could use \"BP: Blood Pressure\". For SBP and DBP we could use \"SBP: Systolic Blood Pressure\", \"DBP: Diastolic Blood Pressure\". For HR we already have HR. For weight we can use \"WT: Weight\". Might be okay.\n\n- Prolactin: New onset >1x ULN etc. Marker: \"Prolactin\". Use \"PRL: Prolactin\".\n\n- AIMS: Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. \"AIMS: Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale\"\n\n- Laboratory parameters: Hematology (Hem), Serum Chemistry (Che), Urinalysis (Uri). Specific labs: Alkaline Phosphatase, AST, Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Creatine Kinase, Creatinine, Glucose, HDL. These are markers: \"Alkaline Phosphatase\", \"Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)\", \"Bilirubin\", \"Cholesterol\", \"Creatine Kinase (CK)\", \"Creatinine\", \"Glucose\", \"High Density Lipoprotein (HDL)\". Use abbreviations: \"ALP: Alkaline Phosphatase\", \"AST: Aspartate Aminotransferase\", \"TBIL: Bilirubin\", \"CHO: Cholesterol\", \"CK: Creatine Kinase\", \"CREAT: Creatinine\", \"GLU: Glucose\", \"HDL: High Density Lipoprotein\". Some may overlap with earlier acronyms like AST already used? Not used elsewhere. Good.\n\nAlso mention \"Hematology\", \"Serum Chemistry\", \"Urinalysis\" as markers? They are tests, but maybe considered markers. We can include them: \"Hem: Hematology\", \"Che: Serum Chemistry\", \"Uri: Urinalysis\".\n\nAlso \"Orthostatic Hypotension\" threshold values: >=20 mmHg decrease in systolic BP and >=25 bpm increase in HR. That is a marker definition. So include \"Orthostatic Hypotension\".\n\nAlso \"Heart Rate Standing\", \"Heart Rate Supine\" thresholds. Maybe separate markers: \"HR Standing\", \"HR Supine\". But we can treat as part of HR.\n\nAlso \"Systolic BP Standing\", \"Systolic BP Supine\", \"Diastolic BP Standing\", \"Diastolic BP Supine\". Could include.\n\nBut we need to avoid duplication. Let's compile unique markers:\n\n- SAS: Parkinsonism Symptom Assessment Scale\n- BMI: Body Mass Index\n- BARS: Akathisia Rating Scale\n- C-SSRS: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale\n- PGI-S: Patient Global Impression – Severity\n- CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression – Improvement\n- CGI-S: Clinical Global Impression – Severity\n- OH: Orthostatic Hypotension\n- HR: Heart Rate\n- SBP: Systolic Blood Pressure\n- DBP: Diastolic Blood Pressure\n- WT: Weight\n- PRL: Prolactin\n- AIMS: Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale\n- Hem: Hematology\n- Che: Serum Chemistry\n- Uri: Urinalysis\n- ALP: Alkaline Phosphatase\n- AST: Aspartate Aminotransferase\n- TBIL: Bilirubin\n- CHO: Cholesterol\n- CK: Creatine Kinase\n- CREAT: Creatinine\n- GLU: Glucose\n- HDL: High Density Lipoprotein\n\nCheck duplicates: none.\n\nNow craft analysis sentence: 4-5 sentences referencing evidence. Provide summary of markers found.\n\nLet's write 4 sentences:\n\n\"The record lists numerous quantitative assessments used to monitor motor, metabolic, and psychiatric status. Key scales include the SAS for Parkinsonian symptoms, BARS for akathisia, C‑SSRS for suicidality, PGI‑S, CGI‑I, and CGI‑S for global impressions, and AIMS for involuntary movements. Physiologic markers such as BMI, orthostatic hypotension, heart rate, systolic/diastolic blood pressures, weight, and prolactin levels are recorded alongside laboratory panels covering hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis with specific thresholds for enzymes and lipids.
