Could be \"Vital Signs Abnormalities\" but that's a category. Might consider \"Vital Signs Abnormalities\" as a marker? It's a measurement of abnormalities in vital signs. We'll include \"Vital Signs Abnormalities: number of participants with clinically relevant abnormalities in vital signs\".\n- Potential Clinical Relevant Laboratory Test Values - Prolactin – could be \"Prolactin Levels\" or \"Prolactin Value\". Since it's a lab test, we can include \"Prolactin: Serum prolactin concentration\".\n- Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Total Score – scale.\n- Potentially Clinically Relevant Laboratory Test Values – generic lab values; but we might include \"Lab Test Values: number of participants with clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities\".\n- Potentially Clinically Relevant Abnormalities in 12-Lead ECG Parameters – \"ECG Abnormalities: number of participants with clinically relevant ECG abnormalities\".\n- Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD) Total Score – scale.\n- Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) Scale Score – scale.\n- Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) – number of participants with TEAEs.\n\nAlso from description: Vital signs details: orthostatic hypotension, heart rate, systolic/diastolic BP, weight. These are components of vital signs. But the marker is \"Vital Signs Abnormalities\".\n\nAlso lab parameters: many labs listed. But the marker is \"Laboratory Test Values\" or \"Lab Abnormalities\". We can include \"Lab Test Values: number of participants with clinically relevant laboratory test abnormalities\".\n\nBut we should avoid duplication. Also we may include \"BMI: Body Mass Index\".\n\nAlso \"Heart Rate Abnormalities\"? Not explicit; just mention vital signs. So keep \"Vital Signs Abnormalities\".\n\nNow produce analysis sentence: 4-5 sentences referencing evidence.\n\nBiomarkers array: each entry format \"ACRONYM: expanded form\". Use uppercase acronym. For some we don't have acronym: e.g., \"Simpson-Angus Scale\" acronym SAS already given. \"Body Mass Index\" BMI. \"Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale\" BARS. \"Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale\" C-SSRS. \"Patient's Global Impression of Severity\" PGI-S. \"Clinical Global Impression - Improvement\" CGI-I. \"Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness\" CGI-S. \"Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale\" AIMS. \"Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder\" ZAN-BPD. \"Patient's Global Impression of Change\" PGI-C. \"Treatment Emergent Adverse Events\" TEAEs. \"Vital Signs Abnormalities\" maybe VSA? But acronym not given. We can create \"VSA: Vital Signs Abnormalities\". \"Laboratory Test Values\" maybe LT: Lab Test Values. \"Prolactin Levels\" PRL? But acronym not given. Use \"PRL: Prolactin\". But better to use \"Prolactin: Serum prolactin concentration\". But rule says use acronym if available. No acronym. We can create \"PRL: Prolactin\". Acceptable.\n\nAlso \"ECG Abnormalities\" maybe ECG-A? But acronym not given. Create \"ECG-A: Electrocardiogram Abnormalities\".\n\nAlso \"BMI\" already.\n\nThus biomarkers list:\n\n\"SAS: Simpson-Angus Scale\"\n\"BMI: Body Mass Index\"\n\"BARS: Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale\"\n\"C-SSRS: Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale\"\n\"PGI-S: Patient's Global Impression of Severity\"\n\"CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression - Improvement\"\n\"CGI-S: Clinical Global Impressions - Severity\"\n\"AIMS: Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale\"\n\"ZAN-BPD: Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder\"\n\"PGI-C: Patient's Global Impression of Change\"\n\"TEAEs: Treatment Emergent Adverse Events\"\n\"VSA: Vital Signs Abnormalities\"\n\"LTA: Laboratory Test Abnormalities\" maybe \"LT: Laboratory Test Values\" but choose \"LT: Laboratory Test Values\"\n\"PRL: Prolactin\"\n\"ECG-A: Electrocardiogram Abnormalities\"\n\nCheck duplicates: none.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\nLet's craft analysis: 4-5 sentences referencing evidence.\n\nOk.",
