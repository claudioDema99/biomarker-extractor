Let's identify:\n\n- CDRS-R: Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (total score)\n- C-GAS: Children's Global Assessment Scale (single score)\n- Semi-structured interview for DSM-IV criteria – maybe \"DSM-IV interview\" but that's not a marker? It's a method, but no explicit quantitative metric. Might skip unless there's a score. It says \"sections were administered.\" No numeric score. So not a marker.\n\n- 4-item measure evaluating attitudes: no acronym, but it's a scale. Could name \"Attitude Scale\" but no acronym. But rule: if no acronym, create logical abbreviation or use shortest recognizable form. Maybe \"ATTS\" or \"ATTITUDE SCALE\". But example didn't do that. In earlier outputs, they listed \"Attitudes Toward Treatment Questionnaire\". They used that name. Here it's described generically. Might call \"Attitude Scale\" but no acronym. However guidelines say always use acronym if available. If none, create logical abbreviation or use shortest recognizable form. So we can use \"ATT\" maybe. But might be ambiguous. But we can include \"Attitude Scale: 4-item measure of attitudes toward treatment\".\n\nBut check examples: In example 2, they had \"Attitudes Toward Treatment Questionnaire\" as marker. That had a name. Here we don't have a formal name. So maybe we exclude it? The instruction: \"extract ONLY markers explicitly present in the text.\" The text describes a 4-item measure but doesn't give a name. Is that a marker? It's a measurement tool. Should we include? Probably yes, as it's a measurement. Use abbreviation \"ATTS\" maybe.\n\n- 11-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing severity of manic episodes: That's the YMRS? Actually YMRS is 11 items. But text didn't mention YMRS acronym. It just says 11-item instrument. But earlier in same record, they mention \"An 11-item clinician-rated instrument...\" but no acronym. But we know YMRS is 11 items. But we can't assume. Must rely on text. There's no acronym. So we treat as \"Manic Severity Scale\" maybe. But we can use \"MS\" abbreviation. But maybe better to use \"Manic Severity Scale\". But guidelines: use acronym uppercase before colon. If no acronym, create logical abbreviation or use shortest recognizable form. So \"MSS\" maybe. We'll include \"MSS: Manic Severity Scale\".\n\n- Self-report 10-item scale for cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression: This is the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire? Not named. So we can call \"ERQ\" maybe. But not given. So maybe \"Emotion Regulation Scale\". Abbreviation \"ERS\". Include.\n\n- Treatment Credibility Questionnaire: TQC? Actually \"Treatment Credibility Questionnaire\" acronym maybe \"TCQ\". Use \"TCQ: Treatment Credibility Questionnaire\".\n\n- General Functioning scale: \"General Functioning Scale\" abbreviation \"GFS\".\n\n- Clinician-administered instrument to parent screening: \"Parent Mood Screening\"? Not named. Use \"PMSS\" maybe. But maybe \"Parent Mood Screening Scale\". Abbrev \"PMSS\".\n\n- SAS-SR: Social Adjustment Scale—Self Report. Already acronym given. So \"SAS-SR: Social Adjustment Scale—Self Report\".\n\n- PHQ-9: Patient Health Questionnaire-9. So \"PHQ-9: Patient Health Questionnaire-9\".\n\n- Self-report inventory for parent screening mania/hypomania: \"Mood History Questionnaire\"? Not named. Use \"MHQ\". But maybe \"Parent Mania History Questionnaire\". Abbrev \"PMHQ\".\n\nAlso note repeated entries: The self-report 10-item scale appears twice; we collapse duplicates.\n\nThus markers list:\n\n- CDRS-R: Children’s Depression Rating Scale‑Revised\n- C-GAS: Children’s Global Assessment Scale\n- ATT: Attitude Scale (4‑item measure of attitudes toward treatment)\n- MSS: Manic Severity Scale (11‑item clinician‑rated instrument)\n- ERS: Emotion Regulation Scale (cognitive reappraisal & expressive suppression)\n- TCQ: Treatment Credibility Questionnaire\n- GFS: General Functioning Scale\n- PMSS: Parent Mood Screening Scale (clinician‑administered instrument to parent)\n- SAS-SR: Social Adjustment Scale—Self Report\n- PHQ-9: Patient Health Questionnaire‑9\n- PMHQ: Parent Mania History Questionnaire (self‑report inventory)\n\nCheck duplicates: ERS appears once.

Actually description matches Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). But it's not named. However we should still capture marker name?

We can create abbreviation maybe \"SDS: Self‑Rated Disability Scale\". But we must use acronym if available. Not available. So we can use \"SDS: Self‑Rated Disability Scale\" or \"Self‑Rated Disability Scale\". Use abbreviation \"SDS\".\n\n- Ten-item diagnostic questionnaire measuring severity of depressive episodes: that's \"Hamilton Depression Rating Scale\"? Wait description: ten items, includes sadness etc. That sounds like \"Beck Depression Inventory\"? Actually BDI has 21 items. This description matches \"Depression Rating Scale\" maybe \"Brief Symptom Inventory\"?

We'll use DRS.\n\n- Scale of 14 items measuring psychic and somatic anxiety: that's \"State-Trait Anxiety Inventory\"? No that's 40 items. Maybe \"Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7\"? No. Could be \"Anxiety Rating Scale\" maybe \"Anxiety Rating Scale (ARS)\". We'll call ARS.\n\n- Guide for rating severity of manic and depressive episodes: that's \"Clinical Global Impressions – Bipolar Version (CGI-BP)\".

    "row_id": 207,
    "cot": "We need to parse the record. Markers present: Timeline Followback (TLFB) – used to assess number of standard alcoholic drinks per week, heavy drinking days. So TLFB is a method, but the marker is the number of standard alcoholic drinks per week? The instruction: include techniques or modalities only if a marker extracted from these techniques is explicitly present. TLFB yields a metric: number of standard alcoholic drinks per week, heavy drinking days count. So markers: \"Standard Alcoholic Drinks per Week\" maybe? But we should format as \"TLFB: Timeline Followback\"?? Wait example: In earlier outputs, they list markers like \"Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)\" etc. They didn't include the technique name separately unless it's part of the marker. For TLFB, the marker is the number of standard alcoholic drinks per week, heavy drinking days. Should we list \"TLFB: Timeline Followback\" as a marker? The guidelines say: \"include techniques or modalities, but only if a marker extracted from these techniques is explicitly present in the text.\" That means if the technique itself is a marker? TLFB is a tool to measure consumption. The marker is the number of drinks. But the tool is also a marker? In previous examples, they listed \"Timeline Followback\" as a marker? Not seen. They listed rating scales. TLFB is a method to quantify consumption. It might be considered a marker. Let's see earlier example 1: They had many rating scales. They didn't mention TLFB. Example 5: They had Proton MR spectroscopy, but they listed markers as \"Glx Concentration\" etc. They didn't list \"Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy\". So we should list the actual biomarker metrics: \"Standard Alcoholic Drinks per Week\" and \"Heavy Drinking Days Count\". Also maybe \"Alcohol By Volume (ABV)\"? That's a parameter used to convert. But ABV is not a marker. It's a property of drink. So markers: \"Standard Alcoholic Drinks per Week\" and \"Heavy Drinking Days\".\n\nAlso \"Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD)\" is a marker: \"HAMD Score\". So we list \"HAMD: Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression Score\".\n\nThus markers array: [\"Standard Alcoholic Drinks per Week\", \"Heavy Drinking Days\", \"HAMD: Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression Score\"].\n\nBut we need to use acronym before colon if available. Standard Alcoholic Drinks per Week doesn't have acronym. Could use \"STD Drnk/Wk\"? But rule says if no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form. We could use \"StdDrinks/Wk\". But maybe simpler: \"StdDrinksPerWeek\". But we need colon after acronym. Eg \"STD: Standard Drinks per Day\". But we don't have acronym. Maybe we can use \"SDW: Standard Alcoholic Drinks per Week\". But that's arbitrary. Might be okay. However earlier examples used \"CDRS-R: Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised Score\". They used acronym from scale. For our case, we can use \"TLFB: Timeline Followback Standard Drinks per Week\" but that mixes technique and metric. But guidelines: include technique only if marker extracted from it is present. Here the marker is the number of drinks. But we can still label as \"TLFB: Timeline Followback Standard Drinks per Week\". That seems acceptable. Similarly \"TLFB: Timeline Followback Heavy Drinking Days\".

    "cot": "We need to parse the record. It describes:\n\n- Visual analogue scales (VAS) for depression, anxiety, euphoria, auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, paranoia, referential thinking, delusions of control. Also mention elation (higher VAS scores for elation indicate mania). So markers: VAS for depression, anxiety, euphoria, auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, paranoia, referential thinking, delusions of control, elation. But we should list each as a marker? The instruction: \"extract ONLY markers explicitly present in the text.\" Markers are quantitative criteria/features. VAS is a technique, but the actual markers are the specific constructs measured: depression, anxiety, euphoria, etc. Should we list each as \"VAS:...\"? In previous outputs, they listed \"YMRS: Young Mania Rating Scale Score\". They didn't list \"VAS\" separately. They listed each scale name. Here we have VAS but it's generic. We might treat each construct as a marker: \"Depression VAS\", \"Anxiety VAS\", etc. But guidelines: \"Each element in the array MUST follow this exact syntax: 'ACRONYM: expanded form of the acronym (or brief description if no acronym exists)'\". So we need an acronym. For VAS, acronym is VAS. Expanded form: Visual Analogue Scale. But we need to capture each marker? Could do \"VAS: Visual Analogue Scale\" but that's generic. However the record specifically lists multiple constructs measured by VAS. Maybe we should list each as separate markers: \"VAS-Depression: Visual Analogue Scale for Depression\", etc. But does that violate rule? It says \"If no acronym exists, create a logical abbreviation or use the shortest recognizable form.\" So we can create abbreviations like \"VAS-D: Visual Analogue Scale for Depression\". But maybe simpler: list \"VAS: Visual Analogue Scale\" only once. But that wouldn't capture the different constructs. The earlier examples: they listed each scale separately, e.g., \"YMRS: Young Mania Rating Scale Score\". They didn't list \"VAS\" because not present. So we should list each distinct marker. Since VAS is used for multiple constructs, we could list each as separate markers with unique acronyms: \"VAS-D: Visual Analogue Scale for Depression\", \"VAS-A: Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety\", etc. But is that acceptable? Might be okay.\n\nAlso there's 2-back task accuracy and reaction time. Those are metrics: accuracy, reaction time. These are markers too. So we should include \"Accuracy: Proportion Correct Responses\" and \"Reaction Time: Time from presentation to response\".\n\nAlso the tone discrimination tasks: equal, longer, shorter intervals. But main outcome is overall accuracy. So accuracy already captured.\n\nThus markers list: VAS-D, VAS-A, VAS-E, VAS-AH, VAS-VH, VAS-PAR, VAS-RT, VAS-REF, VAS-DC, Accuracy, Reaction Time. Also \"Elation VAS\" maybe separate: VAS-Elation. But we already have VAS-E for euphoria. Elation is separate. So VAS-Elation.\n\nLet's craft list:\n\n\"VAS-D: Visual Analogue Scale for Depression\"\n\"VAS-A: Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety\"\n\"VAS-E: Visual Analogue Scale for Euphoria\"\n\"VAS-AH: Visual Analogue Scale for Auditory Hallucinations\"\n\"VAS-VH: Visual Analogue Scale for Visual Hallucinations\"\n\"VAS-PAR: Visual Analogue Scale for Paranoia\"\n\"VAS-RT: Visual Analogue Scale for Referential Thinking\"\n\"VAS-DC: Visual Analogue Scale for Delusions of Control\"\n\"VAS-EL: Visual Analogue Scale for Elation\"\n\"Accuracy: Proportion of Correct Responses in 2-back Task\"\n\"Reaction Time: Time from Presentation to Response\"\n\nCheck duplicates: none.\n\nNow analysis sentence: 4-5 sentences referencing evidence.

Let's enumerate:\n\nMentoring and Communication Support Scale – no acronym. Could use MCSS maybe but not present. Use \"Mentoring and Communication Support Scale\".\n\nSubscales: Collegial Support, Task Support, Career Mentoring, Coaching – but those are subscales of same scale. Should we list them separately?

Total score ranges from 0-21.\" Then later again \"This is a measure of emotion recognition. Total score ranges from 0-19.\" Possibly two different tests. But no names. We'll treat as distinct? Might be same but different scoring. Hard. We can list generic \"Emotion Recognition Ability Test\" and \"Emotion Recognition Measure\". But duplication risk.

    "cot": "We need to parse the record. It describes Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PEC). So marker: PEC total score. Also maybe PEC items? But markers are quantitative criteria/features. The PEC total score is a marker. Also the change from baseline in PEC total score is a marker. So we list \"PEC: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component\". Should we include \"PEC Change\"? According to earlier outputs, they sometimes include \"Change\" markers. In example 1, they listed \"YMRS: Young Mania Rating Scale Change Change in Total Score\". They used \"Change\" suffix. So we should include \"PEC: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component Change in Total Score\" maybe. But the instruction: \"Each element in the array MUST follow this exact syntax: 'ACRONYM: expanded form of the acronym (or brief description if no acronym exists)'\". So we need to provide acronym then colon then expanded form. Not necessarily include \"Change\". In previous outputs, they added \"Change\" in the description part. Eg: 'YMRS: Young Mania Rating Scale Change Change in Total Score'. That includes \"Change\" twice? Actually they wrote \"YMRS: Young Mania Rating Scale Change Change in Total Score\". That's odd duplication. But it's what they used. We should mimic pattern: Provide acronym, colon, expanded form plus descriptor. For PEC, we can write \"PEC: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component Change in Total Score\". Or maybe \"PEC: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component Total Score\". Which matches earlier patterns? In example 1, they had \"YMRS: Young Mania Rating Scale Change Change in Total Score\". They repeated \"Change\". Might be a mistake. But we should keep consistent: Use \"Change\" once? Let's examine example 5: 'Glx Concentration: Glutamate and Glutamine Concentration'. No \"Change\". So they didn't add \"Change\" unless it's a change marker. In example 3, they had 'Glicemia Change: Glucose Levels change in mg/dL'. So they used \"Change\" in the acronym. So for our case, we might want \"PEC Change: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component Change in Total Score\". But the acronym is \"PEC\". Adding \"Change\" to acronym would be \"PEC Change\". But that's not typical. However example 3 used \"Glicemia Change\" as acronym. So it's okay. So we can do \"PEC Change: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component Change in Total Score\".\n\nBut also we might include \"PEC: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component Total Score\".
